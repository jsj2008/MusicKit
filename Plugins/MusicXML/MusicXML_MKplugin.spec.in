%description 
This plugin allows the MusicKit to recognise and interpret MusicXML files. Currently
only reading is supported -- a future version will be able to write MusicXML files
too. File reading is lossy - there are a number of tags that are not read into
MusicKit scores. Almost all tags that can be meaningfully interpreted by the MusicKit
are retained, and a number of others are simply put into MKParameter structures attached
to MKNotes.

# create the specfile from this file with "make specfile", or the whole
# rpm in a oner with "RPM_TOPDIR=/usr/src/redhat make rpm" (as root).
