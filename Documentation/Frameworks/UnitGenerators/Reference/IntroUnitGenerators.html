<i>Music Kit UnitGenerators Library</i>

MKUnitGenerators have two types of state:<br>

<li>	<i>memory arguments</i> describe the UnitGenerator state
and are assumed to be relatively slowly-changing and not necessarily at a
constant sampling rate.   They can be updated, at the fastest, at the audio
sampling rate divided by the "tick size" (which is 16 on the
DSP56001).

<li>	<i>patchpoints</i> represent the signal connections
between UnitGenerators.   They are accessed at a constant sampling rate, which
is the same as the audio sampling rate.
