The files in the directory "OlderConcepts" are identical to some that were in the "Sound, Music, and Signal Processing Concepts" manual from the hard-copy technical documentation shipped in the spring of 1991.  Unlike the "Reference" chapters, the "Concepts" chapters were not distributed as part of the 2.0 Extended or 2.1 Extended software releases.  (They are not available in electronic form directly from NeXT, but can be obtained from the Internet archive servers.)

The "Sound, Music, and Signal Processing Concepts" chapters are based on Release 2.0.

Most of the MusicKit applicable information is now found in the Concepts directory, but some of this may explain the DSP behavior.
