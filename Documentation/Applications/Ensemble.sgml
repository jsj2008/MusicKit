This is an attempt to convert the MusicKit documentation from rtf to
sgml. Doing this while learning sgml, docbook and jade is surely not
a good idea but here goes. General abuse (but preferably useful
information) can be thrown at: dcrowdy@pip.hmn.mq.edu.au

<para>
<application>Ensemble</application>  is a music application.  It is
interactive and primarily MIDI-oriented, in contrast with
<application>Scoreplayer</application>, which is  non-interactive
(except for tempo), and Music Kit Scorefile-oriented.

<para>
<application>Ensemble</application>  supports NeXTstep Help.   For
detailed documentation, launch <application>Ensemble</application> and
select Help? from the menu.

configuration of MIDI,  DSP and/or sound file resources.  The user
interface consists primarily of the performance control panel, the
main heirarchical menu, and one or more document windows.
<para>

<para>
To get started, try opening one of the example documents from
<filename class=directory>LocalLibrary/Music/Ensemble/</filename>.
</para>

<para>
Some of these are algorithmic documents, others play back MIDI
sequences.
