  Description:
    Serial port delegate of MKOrchestra. See the discussion below. With the demise
    of the NeXT hardware, this class becomes an example of DSP operation. In theory it still works.

  @class DSPSerialPortDevice
  @brief

The DSPSerialPortDevice class corresponds to a device that plugs into the DSP
serial port.  Instantiating an instance of the DSPSerialPortDevice class itself
provides you with a serial port protocol that is used by many devices such as
the Ariel Digital Microphone and the Metaresearch Digital Ears.  For other
devices that don't follow that protocol, or for access to "customization"
commands, you may instantiate an instance of a subclass of DSPSerialPortDevice. 
The Music Kit provides a number of such subclasses:

SSAD64x	Singular Solutions AD64x ADC &amp; DAT interface.
StealthDAI2400	Stealth DAI2400 DAT interface.
ArielProPort	Ariel ProPort interface.

These class descriptions appear at the end of this document.  The file
DSPSerialPortDevice.h contains the interface declarations for these classes.  It
also contains defines for "classes" that are fully represented by the
DSPSerialPortDevice class itself:

ArielDigitalMic 	Ariel Digital Microphone 
MRDigitalEars	Metaresearch Digital Ears 

To use a DSPSerialPortDevice or subclass instance, you simply send the orchestra
instance the message <b>setSerialPortDevice:</b><i></i> with an argument of your
DSPSerialPortDevice instance.  In order to access the device for sound output,
you must also send to the orchestra the message <b>setSerialSoundOut:YES</b>.  
Similarly, to access the device for sound input, you must send the orchestra
<b>setSerialSoundIn:YES</b>.  To find out if you can use a particular sampling
rates, you send the message <b>supportsSamplingRate:</b> to the
DSPSerialPortDevice or subclass instance.  To find the default sampling rate,
send it the message <b>defaultSamplingRate</b>.

To implement a new DSPSerialPortDevice subclass for a new device, you override a
number of methods. The most important is <b>setUpSerialPort:</b>.  Other
methods you might want to override include <b>hardwareSupportedSamplingRates:</b>, <b>inputSampleSkip </b>and <b>outputSampleSkip</b>. 

The DSPSerialPortDevice class also supports "half sampling rates".  For
example, if the hardware supports 44100, 48000 and 32000, then the Music Kit
software will also allow the device to be used at 22050, 42000 and 16000.  
These half sampling rates are entirely automatic - the designer of a subclass
need not think about this at all.  He need only implement <b>hardwareSupportedSamplingRates:</b>.  

If you have several Orchestra instances (for example, if you have a cube with an
Ariel QuintProcessor) and each has its own serial port, each can have its own
instance of DSPSerialPortDevice or one of its subclasses.
