  @class MKConductor
  @brief The MKConductor class defines the mechanism that controls the timing of a MusicKit performance. 
 
A MKConductor's most important tasks are
to schedule the sending of MKNotes by MKPerformers (and MKMidi), and
to control the timing of MKEnvelope objects during DSP synthesis.
Even in the absence of MKPerformers and MKEnvelopes, you may want to
use a MKConductor to take advantage of the convenient scheduling
mechanism that it provides.

Each instance of MKConductor contains a message request queue, a list
of messages that are to be sent to particular objects at specific
times.  To enqueue a message request with a MKConductor, you invoke
the <b>sel:to:atTime:argCount:</b> or
<b>sel:to:withDelay:argCount:</b> method.  The former sends a message
at a specific time measured in beats from the time the MKConductor
started performing, while the latter sends the message a specified
number of beats after the request is received.  Once you have made a
message request through these methods, you can't rescind the action;
if you need more control over message requests - for example, if you
need to be able to reschedule or remove a request - you should use the
following C functions:

<ul>
<li> <b>MKNewMsgRequest()</b> creates and returns a new message
request structure.

<li> <b>MKScheduleMsgRequest()</b> places a previously created
message request (structure) in a specific MKConductor's message
request queue.

<li> <b>MKRepositionMsgRequest()</b> repositions a message request
within a MKConductor's queue.

<li> <b>MKCancelMsgRequest()</b> removes a message request.

<li> <b>MKRescheduleMsgRequest()</b> is a convenience function that
cancels a request and then creates a new one.
</ul>

For more information on these functions, see Chapter 3, "C Functions."

The MKConductor class provides two special message request queues, one
that contains messages that are sent at the beginning of a performance
and another for messages that are sent after a performance ends.  The
class methods <b>beforePerformanceSel:to:argCount:</b> and
<b>afterPerformanceSel:to:argCount: </b>enqueue message requests in
the before- and after-performance queues, respectively.

A MusicKit performance starts when the MKConductor class receives the
<b>startPerformance</b> message.  At that time, the MKConductor class
sends the messages in its before-performance queue and then the
MKConductor instances start processing their individual message
request queues.  As a message is sent, the request that prompted the
message is removed from its queue.  The performance ends when the
MKConductor class receives <b>finishPerformance</b>, at which time the
after-performance messages are sent. Any message requests that remain
in the individual MKConductors' message request queues are removed.
Note, however, that the before-performance queue isn't similarly
cleared.  If you invoke <b>beforePerformanceSel:to:argCount:
</b>during a performance, the message request will survive a
subsequent <b>finishPerformance</b> and will affect the next
performance.

By default, if all the MKConductors' queues become empty at the same
time (not including the before- and after-performance queues),
<b>finishPerformance</b> is invoked automatically.  This is convenient
if you're performing a MKPart or MKScore and you want the performance
to end when all the MKNotes have been played.  However, for many
applications, such as those that create and perform MKNotes in
response to a user's actions, universally empty queues isn't
necessarily an indication that the performance is over.  To allow a
performance to continue even if all the queues are empty, send
<b>setFinishWhenEmpty:NO</b> to the MKConductor class.

You can pause and resume an entire performance through methods sent to
the MKConductor class:

<ul>
<li> <b>pausePerformance</b> causes all MKConductor instances to
stop processing their message request queues.

<li> <b>resumePerformance</b> resumes a paused performance.  
</ul>

These messages are ignored if a performance isn't in progress.

You can pause and resume individual MKConductor objects through the
<b>pause</b> and <b>resume</b> methods.  In addition, you can pause a
MKConductor object for a predetermined number of seconds (not beats)
through <b>pauseFor:</b>.  To offset the begin time of a
MKConductor<b></b> object before a performance starts, invoke
<b>setTimeOffset:</b>.  Here again, the arguments is taken as seconds.
You can also offset the begin time of a MKConductor object by an
indeterminate amount of time by sending it the <b>pause</b> message
before a performance begins and then sending it <b>resume</b> while
the performance is in progress.  After a performance has ended, all
currently paused MKConductor objects are (virtually) resumed.  Thus, a
MKConductor object is guaranteed not to be paused when a performance
starts (unless, of course, you have specifically sent it the
<b>pause</b> message since <b>finishPerformance</b> was last sent).

A MKConductor object can be given a delegate that's sent the
<b>hasPaused:</b> message when the MKConductor is paused and
<b>hasResumed:</b> when the MKConductor resumes.  As in the AppKit's
delegate paradigm, a delegate messages is sent only if the delegate
responds to it.

The rate at which a MKConductor object processes its message request
queue can be set through either the <i>Tempo Protocol</i> or the
<i>Time Map Protocol</i>. The <i>Tempo Protocol</i> consists of the
following two methods (you may use either):

<ul>
<li> <b>setTempo:</b> sets the rate as beats per minute.
<li> <b>setBeatSize:</b> sets the size of an individual beat, in seconds. 
</ul>
 
You can change a MKConductor's tempo anytime, even during a
performance.  If your application requires multiple simultaneous
tempi, you need to create more than one MKConductor, one for each
tempo.  A MKConductor's tempo is initialized to 60.0 beats per minute.

An alternative way to modify tempo is to use a tempo track or "Time
Map".  This protocol relies on the MKConductor's delegate to implement
two methods that specify the mapping between "beat time" and "clock
time."  If the delegate implements one of these methods, it must
implement both.  By implementing these methods, the delegate specifies
that it is using the <i>Time Map Protocol</i>.  The two methods are
<b>beatToClock:from:</b> and <b>clockToBeat:from:</b>.  These methods
map from pre-tempo to post-tempo time.  For details, see 
<a href=http://www.musickit.org/MusicKitConcepts/musicperformance.html>
the section entitled Music Performance
</a>

The responsiveness of a performance to the user's actions depends on
whether the MKConductor class is clocked and upon the value of the
performance's <i>delta time</i>.  By default, the MKConductor class is
clocked which means that message request queues are processed in a
timely fashion: If, for example, two requests are specified to be sent
one beat apart, then the message sending mechanism sends the first
message and then, one beat later, sends the second message.  When the
MKConductor class is clocked, a running NSApplication object is
assumed to be present.  If you don't need interactive control over a
performance, you may find it beneficial to have the messages in the
message request queues sent one after another as quickly as possible,
while depending on another device, such as the DSP or MIDI drivers, to
handle the timing of the actual realization (this is further explained
in the descriptions of the MKOrchestra and MKMidi classes).  To allow
the queues to be processed in this way, you set the MKConductor class
to be unclocked by sending it the <b>setClocked:NO</b> message.  If
you set the MKConductor class to be unclocked, be aware that the
<b>startPerformance</b> method doesn't return until the performance is
over.  (In this situation, sending <b>setFinishWhenEmpty:NO</b> to the
MKConductor class is ill-advised since <b>startPerformance</b> would
never return.)

Setting a performance's delta time further refines the responsiveness
of a performance. Delta time is set through the <b>setDeltaT:</b>
class method; the argument defines an imposed time lag, in seconds,
between the MKConductor's notion of time and that of the DSP and MIDI
device drivers.  It acts as a timing cushion that can help to maintain
rhythmic integrity by granting your application a sort of
computational head start: As you set the delta time to larger values,
your application has more time to process MKNotes before they are
realized.  However, this computational advantage is obtained at the
expense of degraded responsiveness.  Choosing the proper delta time
value depends on how responsive your application needs to be.  For
example, if you are driving DSP synthesis from MIDI input (in other
words, you have a MKMidi object connected to a MKSynthInstrument -
this is usually the most demanding scenario in terms of desired
real-time response), a delta time of as much as 10 milliseconds (0.01
seconds) is generally acceptable.  If you are adjusting MKNote
parameters by moving a NSSlider with the mouse, a delta time of 100
milliseconds or more can be tolerated.  Finding the right delta time
for your application is largely a matter of experimentation.

Every MKConductor instance has a notion of the current time measured
in its own tempo, as returned by sending it the <b>time</b> message.
The returned value is the number of beats the receiver has spent in
performance and doesn't include the receiver's time offset, any time
it has spent while paused, nor does it include the performance's delta
time.  The MKConductor class also responds to the <b>time</b> message;
it returns the current duration of the performance in seconds,
excluding any time that the entire performance has been paused (and
also excluding deltat time).  The value returned by the <b>time</b>
message, whether sent to the MKConductor class or to an instance, is
actually the time at which the last message from any of the
MKConductors' queues was sent.  This latency is present because the
MKConductor class updates its notion of time (from which all the
MKConductor instances compute their time) only when a message from one
of the request queues is sent.  If your application sends a message
(or calls a C function) in response to an asynchronous event, it must
first update the MKConductors' notions of time by bracketing the code
you invoke with <b>[MKConductor lockPerformance]</b> and
<b>[MKConductor unlockPerformance]</b>.  You should send these
messages before performing tasks such as pausing or resuming a
MKConductor - you should even send them immediately before sending
<b>finishPerformance</b>.  If, for yet another example, your
application sends MKNotes directly to MKInstruments, you should send
<b>lockPerformance</b> immediately before each MKNote is sent and
<b>unlockPerformance</b> afterwards.  (This API supercedes the older
<b>adjustTime</b>, which will still work only if the MusicKit is not
run in a separate thread.  See <b>+useSeparateThread:</b>.)

MKConductors and MKPerformers have a special relationship: Every
MKPerformer object is controlled by an instance of MKConductor, as set
through MKPerformer's <b>setConductor:</b> method.  While a
MKPerformer can be controlled by only one MKConductor, a single
MKConductor can control any number of MKPerformers.  As a MKPerformer
acquires successive MKNotes, it enqueues, with its associated
MKConductor, requests for the MKNotes to be sent to its connected
MKInstruments. This enqueuing is performed automatically through a
mechanism defined by the MKPerformer class. As a convenience, the
MusicKit automatically creates an instance of MKConductor called the
<i>defaultConductor</i>; if you don't set a MKPerformer's MKConductor
directly, it's controlled by the defaultConductor. You can retrieve the
defaultConductor (in order to set its tempo or to enqueue message
requests, for example) by sending the <b>defaultConductor</b> message
to the MKConductor class.

The MusicKit also creates an instance of MKConductor called the
<i>clockConductor</i>, which you can retrieve through the
<b>clockConductor</b> class method.  The clockConductor has an
unchangeable tempo of 60.0 beats per minute and can't be paused.
While the clockConductor can be used to control MKPerformers, its
most important task is to control the timing of MKEnvelope objects
during DSP synthesis.  All MKEnvelopes are controlled by the
clockConductor automatically.  The clockConductor also controls
the duration of any MKNoteDurs that you send directly to an
MKInstrument. In other words, the duration of such a MKNote is always
computed using the 60.0 beats-per-minute tempo of the clockConductor.  

The clockConductor's queue is treated like any other queue:
You can enqueue message requests with the clockConductor just as
you would with any other MKConductor. This also means that the
clockConductor's queue contributes to a determination of whether
all the queues are empty.

MKConductors can synchronize to incoming MIDI time code. This functionality is described in 
<a href=http://www.musickit.org/MusicKitConcepts/miditimecode.html>

  <b>MKSetDeltaT()</b> sets a performance's delta time in seconds.  The

  "mode", which is set with <b>MKSetDeltaTMode()</b>.  In
  MK_DELTAT_DEVICE_LAG mode, deltaT is added into the timestamps of DSP
  and MIDI messages, thus imposing a time lag between the MusicKit and
  these devices. If, on the other hand, the delta time mode is
  MK_DELTAT_SCHEDULER_ADVANCE, then deltaT is the amount by which the
  MusicKit MKConductor attempts to run ahead of the devices.  In either
  case, the lag is sometimes necessary to allow the MusicKit sufficient
  compute time while maintaining rhythmic integrity.  Effective delta time
  values can be quite small; for an application that requires real-time
  response, a delta time of as much as 10 milliseconds (0.01 seconds) is
  tolerable.  Delta time only affects devices that are timed.  In
