/* 
  Modification history prior to commit to CVS:

  07/27/90/daj - Created.
  08/10/90/daj - Added thread_policy setting. 
  08/13/90/daj - Added enabling of FIXEDPRI policy for apps running as root
                 (or for apps running in an environment in which FIXEDPRI
		 policy has been enabled.)
  08/17/90/daj - Added cthread_yield when we're "behind".
  08/18/90/daj - Added lock as first thing in separate thread.
  08/20/90/daj - Added _MKGetConductorThreadStress and 
                 _MKSetConductorMaxThreadStress
  09/04/90/daj - Added check for overflow of msg_receive timeout.
  09/06/90/daj - Added additional bit poll to make sure things haven't changed
                 out from under us. Also added terminating of thread from
		 removeTimedEntry to avoid bad situations when someone does
		 a finishPerformance followed by startPerformance while holding
		 the lock!
  09/26/90/daj - Added adjustTimedEntry() if needed after MIDI is received.
                 (Formerly, timedEntry->timeToWait was not being reset unless
		 something is rescheduled for the head of the queue. Thus,
		 the time between the last scheduled event and the incoming
		 MIDI was not being subtracted.)
  09/29/90/daj - Changed to use condition signal to flush old thread.
  10/01/90/daj - Changed resetPriority to always do it.		 
  12/12/90/daj - Plugged memory leak in _MKRemovePort() 
  03/05/91/daj - Changed to new scheme of doing fixed policy.
  04/22/91/daj - Changed separate-threaded finishPerformance to do longjmp
  07/22/91/daj - Changed unlockIt() to NOT do a recursive lock in certain
                 cases, thus making buggy user code more likely to work.
		 (Especially, this fixes the case where the user does a 
		 lockPerformance followed by a finishPerformance from the 
		 Music Kit thread.) 
  08/27/91/daj - Simplified error messages.
  11/17/92/daj - Added more robust search for fixedpolicy
  07/1/93/daj -  Added an arg to machErr for more descritptive error reporting.
  02/7/94/daj -  Changed to only unlock/lock when timeout != 0
  11/5/94/daj -  Changed thread endgame

/* Will the following scenario work and is it safe?

   Thread A is sitting in a msg_receive on a port set.

   What is funny about this example is that normally when thread A is in
   the msg_receive, it doesn't have the lock. Therefore, thread B thinks it
   can modify the data. But the one piece of data thread A is still using
   is the port set!

   The alternative is, I guess, the following:

   Thread B sends a message to thread A, thus rousing it from the msg_receive
   and telling thread A to add the port that thread B wanted to add.
