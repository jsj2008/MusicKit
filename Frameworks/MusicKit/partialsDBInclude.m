  Revision 1.3  2001/09/06 21:27:48  leighsmith
  Merged RTF Reference documentation into headerdoc comments and prepended MK to any older class names

  Revision 1.2  1999/07/29 01:26:15  leigh
  Added Win32 compatibility, CVS logs, SBs changes

  09/22/89/daj - Add 'const' all over the place to make these things go in
                 text segment (in preparation for shlibs).
  08/17/90/daj - Changed to use new float/int format MKPartials objects.
                 See comments in partialsDB.m and MKPartials.m
  08/12/91/daj - Changed to use new mid-point freq format.
  05/31/92/daj - Changed const synthptr to synthptr
