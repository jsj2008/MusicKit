  Description: 
    The MKMidi object provides MIDI input/output access. It emulates some of the
    behavior of a MKPerformer: It contains a NSMutableArray of MKNoteSenders, one per MIDI
    channel (as well as an extra one for MIDI system and channel mode messages).
    You can receive MKNotes derived from MIDI input by connecting an MKInstrument's
    MKNoteReceivers to the MKNoteSenders of a MKMidi instance.
   
    Similarly, MKMidi emulates some of the behavior of an MKInstrument: It contains
    an array of MKNoteReceivers, one per MIDI channel (as well as the extra one).
    You can send MKNotes to MIDI output by connecting a MKPerformer's MKNoteSenders
    to the MKNoteReceivers of a MKMidi instance.
   
    However, the MKMidi object is unlike a MKPerformer in that it represents a 
    real-time  device. In this manner, MKMidi is somewhat like MKOrchestra, 
    which represents the DSP. The protocol for controlling MKMidi is the same 
    as that for the MKOrchestra. This protocol is described in the file 
    <MusicKit/MKDeviceStatus.h>.
    
    The conversion between MusicKit and MIDI semantics is described in the
    MusicKit documentation.

  @class MKMidi
  @brief A MKMidi object lets you communicate with a MIDI synthesizer by providing a
  simple interface to the MIDI device driver.
 
The MKMidi class also provides a mechanism that automatically converts MIDI messages
into MKNote objects and vice versa, allowing you to incorporate MIDI data into a MusicKit
application with a minimum of effort.

While inheriting neither from MKPerformer nor MKInstrument, the MKMidi
class emulates both of them: Like a MKPerformer, it contains a NSArray
of MKNoteSenders, and, like an MKInstrument, it contains a NSArray of
MKNoteReceivers.  A newly created MKMidi object contains 17
MKNoteSenders and 17 MKNoteReceivers, one for each of the 16 Voice
Channels and one for the Basic Channel.  (Note, however, that the
method <b>setMergeInput:</b> allows the option of all messages to be
sent via MKNoteSender 0.  Similarly, if a MKNote is sent to
MKNoteReceiver 0, the MK_midiChan parameter of that MKNote determines
on which MIDI channel it is sent.)

Before a MKMidi object can receive messages from or send messages to
an external synthesizer, it must be sent the <b>open</b> and
<b>run</b> messages:

<ul>
<li>	<b>open</b> establishes communication between the object and the MIDI driver.</li> 
<li>	<b>run</b> starts the driver's clock ticking.</li>
</ul>

Balancing these two methods are <b>stop</b> and <b>close</b>:

<ul>
<li>	<b>stop</b> stops the driver's clock.</li>
<li>	<b>close</b> breaks communication between the object and the MIDI driver.</li>
</ul>

The state of a MKMidi object with respect to the foregoing methods is
described in its <b>deviceStatus</b> instance variable:

<ul>
<li>	MK_devOpen.  The MKMidi object is open but not running.</li>
<li>	MK_devRunning.  The object is open and running.</li>
<li>	MK_devStopped.  The object has been running, but is now stopped.</li>
<li>	MK_devClosed.  The object is closed.</li>
</ul>

(Note that these are the same methods and MKDeviceStatus values used
to control and describe the status of an MKOrchestra object.)

The MIDI driver has its own clock that's generally more regular and
steadfast than the MKConductor's clock.  To take advantage of this,
the MKConductor is, by default, synched to incoming MIDI messages:
When a MIDI message arrives, the MKConductor's clock is set to the
time stated in the message timestamp.  You can disable this feature
by sending <b>setUseInputTimeStamps: NO</b> to a MKMidi object.

On the other side, as a MKMidi object initiates an outgoing MIDI
message, it gives the message a timestamp that indicates when the
message should be performed by the external MIDI device.  By default,
the MIDI driver looks at the timestamp and waits until the appropriate
time (as determined by its own clock) to send the message on to the
synthesizer.  By sending <b>setOutputTimed: NO</b> to a MKMidi object,
you can specify that the driver is to ignore the timestamps and send
all messages as soon as it receives them.

Note that in all cases the MKConductor that's overseeing the MusicKit 
performance must be clocked if you want to use a MKMidi object.

As MKMidi receives MIDI messages it creates MKNote objects following these rules:

<ul>
<li>For each MIDI message that has a Note Number, a MKNote object is created and
  given a noteTag that corresponds to the combination of the message's Channel 
  Number and Note Number.</li>

<li>If multiple Note Offs are received (for a particular Channel/Note number) without
  intervening Note Ons, only the first Note Off is converted into a MKNote object. 
  The others are suppressed.</li>

<li>A Note On message with a MIDI Velocity of 0 is turned into a MKNote object of type noteOff.</li>

<li>If a Note Off message has a MIDI Release Velocity of 0, the MK_releaseVelocity parameter in
  the corresponding MKNote object is omitted.</li>
</ul>
 
In sending messages to an external synthesizer, MKMidi converts MKNote objects to MIDI messages:

<ul>
<li>If two successive noteOns have the same noteTag and the same MK_keyNum value, a Note Off
  is generated on the same channel and with the same Key Number as those for the Note Ons.</li>

<li>If two successive noteOns have the same noteTag but different MK_keyNum values, the second
  Note On message is followed by a Note Off with the Key Number of the first Note On.</li>  
  This is to accommodate MIDI Mono Mode.

<li>A noteOff with no MK_relVelocity parameter is converted to a Note On with a Velocity of 0.</li>
</ul>

A number of parameters are provided to accommodate MIDI messages.  These are described in
<a href=http://www.musickit.org/MusicKitConcepts/representationofmidi.html>
the section titled Representation of MIDI in the MusicKit
</a>.

A MKMidi object can be used to synchronize a performance to incoming
MIDI time code.  To do so, send a MKConductor the message
<b>setMTCSynch:</b>, with a MKMidi object as the argument.  For
further information on MIDI time code, see 
<a href=http://www.musickit.org/MusicKitConcepts/miditimecode.html>
the appendix titled MIDI Time Code in the MusicKit
</a>.

The MIDI synthesizer is attached to a serial port at the back of a NeXT computer,
to a MPU-401 compatible card installed in a P.C., to a MIDI device defined within 
Microsoft Windows DirectMusic or to a MIDI device defined within Apple MacOS X CoreMIDI.
