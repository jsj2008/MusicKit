  @brief When reading a scorefile, processing MIDI, etc., the MusicKit creates
  MKNote objects. Use MKSetNoteClass() to substitute your own MKNote subclass.

  When you read a scorefile into your application, some number of objects
  are automatically created.  Specifically, these objects are instances of
  MKNote, MKPart, MKEnvelope, MKPartials, and MKSamples.  You can supply your
  own classes from which these instances are created through these
  functions.  The one restriction is that the class that you set must be a
  subclass of the original class; for example, the class that you pass the
  argument to <b>MKSetNoteClass()</b> must be a subclass of MKNote.
  This function does not effect objects returned by [MKNote new]; these are
  instances of the MKNote class, as usual.
     
  The <b>MKGet<i>Class</i>Class()</b> functions return the requested
  classes as set through the  functions above.
  @param  noteSubclass is a MKNote.
  @return <b>MKSet<i>Class</i>Class()</b> returns NO if the argument isn't a
   subclass of <b><i>Class</i></b>; otherwise it returns YES.
