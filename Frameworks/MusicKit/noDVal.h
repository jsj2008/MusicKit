  Description:
    This is used by the Music Kit to signal "no value" from functions and
    methods that return double. The value MK_NODVAL is a particular "NaN"
    ("not a number"). You cannot test its value directly.
    Instead, use MKIsNoDVal().

    Example:

         double myFunction(int arg)
         {
                 if (arg == 2)
                         return MK_NODVAL;
                 else return (double) arg * 2;
         }

         main()
         {
                 double d = myFunction(2);
                 if (MKIsNoDVal(d))
                         printf("Illegal value.\n");
         }

  @brief Returns the special NaN that the MusicKit uses to signal "no value".

  A number of MusicKit functions and methods query for and return
  <b>double</b>-valued quantities, such as the values of parameters and
  time tags.  By convention, the value MK_NODVAL is returned if the
  queried-for value hasn't been set; however, you can't test for this
  value directly.  You must use the function <b>MKIsNoDVal()</b> instead,
  passing as the argument the value that you wish to test.  The function
  returns nonzero if <i>value</i> is equal to MK_NODVAL and 0 if it isn't.
     
  <b>MKGetNoDVal()</b> returns the no-<b>double</b>-value indicator. 
  You use this function as the return value for functions and methods of
  your own design in which you wish to indicate that a
  <b>double</b>-valued quantity hasn't been set.  For convenience,
  MK_NODVAL is defined as this function.  
  @return Returns an int.
