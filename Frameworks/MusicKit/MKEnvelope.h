  @class MKEnvelope
  @brief The MKEnvelope class provides basic support for creating line segment functions. 
  
  

The MKEnvelope class provides basic support for creating line segment functions. 
An MKEnvelope consists of a series of <i>breakpoints</i> each consisting of three
values:  <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>smoothing</i>.  The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
values locate a value <i>y</i> at a particular time <i>x</i>. There is also a
<i>smoothing</i> value associated with each breakpoint that is used primarily in
<b>AsympUG</b>, a MKUnitGenerator that creates asymptotic envelope functions on
the DSP.  <i>Smoothing</i> defines the shape of the curve between
breakpoints.

There are two ways to use an MKEnvelope: as a continuous function during DSP
synthesis or to return a discrete value <i>y</i> for a given <i>x</i>. 

To fill an MKEnvelope object with data, you invoke the method
	
<b>setPointCount:</b>	
<b>xArray:</b>	
<b>orSamplingPeriod:</b>	
<b>yArray:</b>	
<b>smoothingArray:</b>	
<b>orDefaultSmoothing:</b>

The argument to <b>setPointCount:</b> specifies the number of breakpoints in the
MKEnvelope; the arguments to <b>xArray:</b>, <b>yArray:</b>, and
<b>smoothingArray:</b> are pointers to arrays of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and
<i>smoothing</i> values for the Envelope's breakpoints.  The range of musically
useful <i>y</i> values depends on the parameter that the MKEnvelope will affect.
For example, amplitude normally is between 0.0 and 1.0, while frequency is
expressed in Hz and assumes values over the range of human  hearing.  The
breakpoints in an MKEnvelope must succeed each other in time; thus, the values in
the <i>x</i> array must get successively larger.  By default, the <i>x</i>
values are taken as seconds, although this interpretation can be modified
through the use of auxilliary parameters, as explained below. 

While you must always supply an array of <i>y</i> values, the same isn't true
for <i>x</i> and <i>smoothing</i>.  Rather than provide an <i>x</i> array, you
can specify, as the argument to <b>orSamplingPeriod:</b>, a <i>sampling
period</i> that's used as an <i>x</i> increment:  The <i>x</i> value of the
first breakpoint is 0.0, successive <i>x</i> values are integer multiples of the
sampling period value.  Similarly, you can supply a constant <i>smoothing</i>
value, as the argument to <b>orDefaultSmoothing:</b>, rather than provide a
<i>smoothing</i> array.  In the presence of both an <i>x</i> array and a
sampling period, or both a <i>smoothing</i> array and a default
<i>smoothing</i>, the array takes precedence.

The shorthand method <b>setPointCount:xArray:yArray:</b> can also be used to
fill an MKEnvelope with data.

Envelopes are described as having three parts:  attack, sustain, and release. 
You can set the sustain portion of an MKEnvelope by designating one of its
breakpoints as the <i>stickpoint</i> through the <b>setStickPoint:</b> method. 
Everything up to the stickpoint is the Envelope's attack; everything after the
stickpoint is its release.  When the stickpoint is reached during DSP synthesis,
its y value is sustained until a <b>noteOff</b> arrives to signal the release
(keep in mind that a <b>noteDur</b> is split into a <b>noteOn</b>/<b>noteOff</b>
pair by MKSynthInstrument<b></b>objects).

An MKEnvelope object is set as the value of a Note's parameter through Note's
<b>setPar:toEnvelope:</b> method.  Parameters that accept MKEnvelope objects
usually have associated with them several other parameters that interpret the
MKEnvelope by scaling and offsetting the Envelope's <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values. 

For example, the <b>MK_ampEnv</b> parameter takes an MKEnvelope as its value; <b>
MK_amp0</b>and<b> MK_amp1</b>  are constant-valued parameters that scale and
offset the y values in <b>MK_ampEnv</b> according to the formula
	
(<i>scale</i>* y) + <i>offset</i>

where <i>scale</i> is calculated as <b>MK_amp1</b> - <b>MK_amp0</b> and offset
is simply the value of <b>MK_amp0</b>.  In other words, <b>MK_amp0</b> defines
the interpreted value when <i>y</i> is 0.0 and <b>MK_amp1</b> is the interpreted
value when <i>y</i> is 1.0.  
While an Envelopes's x values are normally taken as an absolute time in seconds,
MKSynthPatches usually provide additional parameters that let you reset the attack
and release durations.  For example, the <b>MK_ampAtt</b> parameter  resets the
duration of the attack portion of a Note's amplitude MKEnvelope; similarly,
<b>MK_ampRel</b> resets the release duration. 

When used in DSP synthesis, MKEnvelope objects are applied by a MKUnitGenerator such
as <b>AsympUG</b>.  AsympUG creates asymptotic curves between breakpoints.  The
shape of a  segment going into a particular breakpoint is determined by that
breakpoint's <i>smoothing</i> value (the <i>smoothing</i> value of the first
breakpoint is ignored).  <i>Smoothing</i> values should be between 0.0 and 1.0
where 0.0 means no <i>smoothing</i> (a stairstep function), and 1.0 takes the
entire duration between points to arrive at (near) the <i>y</i> value.  More
precisely, a <i>smoothing</i> of 1.0 signifies that the AsympUG<b></b> will
reach within -48dB of the <i>y</i> value.  A smoothing in excess of 1.0 causes
the
AsympUG trajectory to fall short of the next point's <i>y</i> value.  See the
AsympUG class description for the formula used to compute the asymptotic
function.

Although MKEnvelope objects are most commonly used in  DSP synthesis, they can
also be used to return a discrete value of <i>y</i> for a given <i>x</i>, as
provided in the method <b>lookupYForX:</b>.  Discrete-value lookup is useful for
controlling the way a constant-valued parameter evolves over a <i>series</i> of
MKNotes.  If the <i>x</i> value doesn't correspond exactly to a breakpoint in the
MKEnvelope, the method does a linear interpolation between the immediately
surrounding breakpoints.  

Envelopes are automatically created by the Music Kit in a number of
circumstances, such as when reading a Scorefile.  The function
<b>MKSetEnvelopeClass()</b> allows you to specify that your own subclass of
MKEnvelope be used when Envelopes are automatically created.
