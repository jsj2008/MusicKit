  @class MKScore

  @brief A MKScore is a collection of MKPart objects.  MKScores can be read from and
    written to a scorefile or midifile, performed with a MKScorePerformer,
    and can be used to record MKNotes from a MKScoreRecorder.

A MKScore is a collection of MKPart objects.  MKScores can be read from
and written to a <b>.score</b> or <b>.playscore </b> scorefile or a
Standard MIDI file, performed with a MKScorePerformer, and can be used
to record MKNotes from a MKScoreRecorder.

Each MKScore has an info MKNote (a mute) that defines, in its
parameters, information that can be useful in performing or otherwise
interpreting the MKScore.  Typical information includes tempo, DSP
headroom (see the MKOrchestra Class), and sampling rate (the
parameters MK_tempo, MK_headroom, and MK_samplingRate are provided to
accommodate this utility).

When you read a scorefile into a MKScore, a MKPart object is created
and added to the MKScore for each MKPart name in the file's <b>part</b>
statement.  If the MKScore already contains a MKPart with the same
name as a MKPart in the file, the MKNotes from the two sources are
merged together in the existing MKPart in the MKScore.

MKScoreFile <b>print</b> statements are printed as the scorefile is
read into a MKScore.  You can set the stream on which the messages are
printed by invoking <b>setScorefilePrintStream:</b>.

  A midifile is converted into MKNotes as follows:
  
  If the file is format 0, the Channel Voice messages are
  written into 16 MKParts, one for each channel.  Channel
  Mode and System messages are combined in an additional
  MKPart.  The midi channel of a particular MKPart can be
  determined by examining the MK_midiChan parameter of the
  MKPart info MKNote.  The special MKPart has no
  MK_midiChan parameter.
  
  If the file is format 1, each track is written to a
  separate MKPart.  The track number is set in the MKPart
  info's MK_track parameter.
  
  If the file is format 2, each track is written to a
  separate MKPart.  The track number is set in the MKPart
  info's MK_sequence parameter.
  
  Tempo is encoded in the MK_tempo parameter of the
  MKScore's info.  Similarly, copyright shows up in the
  MKScore's info as an MK_copyright parameter.
  
  The info of each MKPart that corresponds to a track is
  given an MK_instrumentName parameter if a corresponding
  meta-event appears in the file.
  
  Other MIDI file meta-events such as time signature,
  lyric, etc. appear as corresponding MKNote parameters in
  mute MKNotes in the appropriate MKPart.
  
  The current contents of the MKScore are not affected.
  The new MKParts are never merged with the current
  contents.  Instead, new MKParts are added to the
  MKScore.

  timeTags and durations are modified according to the tempo.  For
  example, if the tempo is 120 and a MIDI note begins at time 1.0 in

  MKNote will have a timeTag of 0.5 and a duration of 0.25.  
  Similarly, when writing files, the tempo is taken into account.  For

  0.5 and a duration of 0.25, it is converted back to a MIDI note that
  begins at time 1.0 and lasts for a half of a beat.
