  @class MKPart
  @brief A MKPart is a timeTag-ordered collection of MKNotes that can be edited
  performed, and realized.  MKParts are typically grouped together in an MKScore.

A MKPart is a timeTag-ordered collection of MKNotes that can be edited
performed, and realized.  MKParts are typically grouped together in a MKScore.

A MKNote can belong to only one MKPart at a time, and a MKPart to only
one MKScore.  When you add a MKNote to a MKPart, it's automatically
removed from its old MKPart.  Similarly, adding a MKPart to a MKScore
removes it from its previous MKScore.

You can add MKNotes to a MKPart either by invoking one of MKPart's
<b>addNote:</b> methods, or by &ldquo;recording&rdquo; them with a
MKPartRecorder, a type of MKInstrument that realizes MKNotes by adding
copies of them to a specified MKPart.  Any number of MKPartRecorders
can simultaneously record into the same MKPart.  A MKPart is added to
a MKScore through MKPart's <b>addToScore:</b> method (or the
equivalent MKScore method <b>addPart:</b>).

Within a MKPart, MKNotes are ordered by their time tag values, lowest
to highest.  To move a MKNote within a MKPart, you simply change the
MKNote's time tag (through MKNote's <b>setTimeTag:</b> method).  For
efficiency, a MKPart sorts itself only when its MKNotes are retrieved
or when a MKNote is moved within the MKPart (or removed altogether).
In other words, adding a MKNote to a MKPart won't cause the MKPart to
sort itself; but keep in mind that since adding a MKNote to a MKPart
automatically removes it from its current MKPart, the act will cause
the moved-from MKPart to sort itself.  You can force a MKPart to sort
itself by sending it a <b>sort</b>message.

A MKPart can be a source of MKNotes in a performance through
association with a MKPartPerformer.  During a performance, the
MKPartPerformer reads the MKNotes in the MKPart, performing them in
order.  While you shouldn't free a MKPart or any of its MKNotes while
an associated MKPartPerformer is active, you can add MKNotes to and
remove MKNotes from the MKPart at any time without affecting the
MKPartPerformer's performance.

  A MKPart can be performed using a MKPartPerformer and can 'record' notes
  by using a MKPartRecorder. You must not free a MKPart or any of the MKNotes
  in a MKPart while there are any MKPartPerformers using the MKPart. It is ok
  to record to a part and perform that part at the same time because the
  MKPartPerformer takes a snap-shot of the MKPart when the MKPartPerformer
  is activated.

A MKPartPerformer creates its own NSMutableArray of the MKPart's
MKNotes when it receives the setPart: message (but keep in mind that
it doesn't make copies of the MKNotes themselves); changes to the MKPart
made during a performance won't affect the MKPartPerformer.  This
allows a MKPart to be performed by a MKPartPerformer and used for
recording by a MKPartRecorder at the same time.

To each MKPart you can give an info MKNote, a sort of header for the
MKPart that can contain any amount and type of information.  Info
MKNotes are typically used to describe a performance setup; for
example, an info MKNote might contain, as a parameter, the name of the
MKSynthPatch subclass on which the MKNotes in the MKPart are meant to
be synthesized.  When the MKPart's MKScore is written to a scorefile,
the info MKNote is written in the file's header; this is in
distinction to the MKPart's other MKNotes, which make up the body of
the scorefile.  (To store a MKPart in a scorefile you must first add
it to a MKScore and then write the MKScore.)

Keep in mind that a MKPart's info MKNote must be interpreted by your
application if it is to have any effect.  A few parameters defined by
the MusicKit are designed specifically to be used in a MKPart's info
MKNote.  These are listed in the description of the <b>setInfo:</b>
method, below.  The info MKNote is stored separately from the MKNotes
in the body of the MKPart; most of the MKNote-accessing methods, such
as <b>empty</b>, <b>nth:</b>, and <b>next:</b>, don't apply to the
info MKNote.  The exceptions - the methods that <i>do</i> affect the
info MKNote - are so noted in their descriptions below.

MKParts are commonly given string name identifiers, through the
<b>MKNameObject()</b> C function.  The most important use of a
MKPart's name is to identify the MKPart in a scorefile.

MKParts are automatically created by the MusicKit in a number of
circumstances, such as when reading a MKScorefile.  The function
<b>MKSetPartClass()</b> allows you to specify that your own subclass
of MKPart be used when MKParts are automatically created.  You
retrieve the MKPart class with <b>MKGetPartClass()</b>.

Editing a MKPart refers generally to adding and removing MKNotes,
not to changing the contents of the MKNotes themselves (although
some methods do both; see <b>splitNotes</b> and <b>combineNotes</b>).
MKNotes are ordered within the MKPart by their timeTag values.
To move a MKNote within a MKPart, you simply change its timeTag by
sending it the appropriate message (see the MKNote class).
This effectively removes the MKNote from its MKPart, changes the timeTag,
and then adds it back to its MKPart.

The MKNotes in a MKPart are stored in a NSArray object. The NSArray is only sorted
when necessary. In particular, the NSArray is sorted, if necessary, when an
access method is invoked. The access methods are:
  
<ul>
  <li><tt>firstTimeTag: (double) firstTimeTag lastTimeTag: (double) lastTimeTag;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>atTime: (double) timeTag;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>atOrAfterTime: (double) timeTag;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>nth: (unsigned) n;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>atOrAfterTime: (double) timeTag nth: (unsigned) n;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>atTime: (double) timeTag nth: (unsigned) n;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>next: (MKNote *) aNote;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>notes;</tt></li>
</ul>

  Other methods that cause a sort, if necessary, are:
  
<ul>
  <li><tt>combineNotes;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>removeNotes: (NSArray *) aList;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>removeNote: (MKNote *) aNote;</tt></li>
</ul>

  Methods that may alter the NSArray such that its MKNotes are no longer sorted are
  the following:

<ul>
  <li><tt>addNoteCopies: (NSArray *) aList timeShift: (double) shift;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>addNotes: (NSArray *) aList timeShift: (double) shift;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>addNote: (MKNote *) aNote;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>addNoteCopy: (MKNote *) aNote;</tt></li>
  <li><tt>splitNotes;</tt></li>
</ul>
  
This scheme works well for most cases. However, there are situations where
it can be problematic. For example:
  
<tt>
  for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;[aPart addNote: anArray[i]];<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;[aPart removeNote: anotherArray[i]];<br>
  }
</tt>

In this case, the MKPart will be sorted each time removeNote: is called,
causing N-squared behavior. You can get around this by first adding all the
notes using addNotes: and then removing all the notes using removeNotes:.

In some cases, you may find it most convenient to
remove the MKNotes from the MKPart, modify them in your own
data structure, and then reinsert them into the MKPart.

You can explicitly trigger a sort (if needed) by sending the -<b>sort</b> message.
This is useful if you ever subclass MKPart.

To get a sorted copy of the NSArray of notes use the -<b>notes</b> method.
To get the NSArray of notes itself, use the -<b>notesNoCopy</b> method.
  -<b>notesNoCopy</b> does not guarantee the MKNotes are sorted.
If you want to examine the MKNotes in-place sorted, first send -<b>sort</b>, then
  -<b>notesNoCopy</b>.

You can find out if the NSArray is currently sorted by the -<b>isSorted</b> method.
