%description 
This package holds (mainly) stubs for DSP synthesis functions. On NeXTSTEP,
the DSP framework held code for talking to the Motorola DSP56k chip. It
should really be deprecated, except that future host-based DSP routines
may use a similar API.

# create the specfile from this file with "make specfile", or the whole
# rpm in a oner with "RPM_TOPDIR=/usr/src/redhat make rpm" (as root).
