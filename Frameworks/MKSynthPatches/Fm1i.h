  @class Fm1i
  @ingroup FrequencyModulationSynthesis
  @brief FM with arbitrary waveforms for carrier and modulator and an interpolating
  oscillator for the carrier. 
  
<b>Fm1i</b> is an FM (frequency modulation) MKSynthPatch that uses an
arbitrary-wavetable oscillator to modulate the frequency of another
arbitrary-wavetable oscillator.  <b>Fm1i</b> uses an interpolating oscillator
for the carrier, while <b>Fm1</b> uses a non-interpolating oscillator (lower
quality, but uses less DSP computation.) 
<b>Fm1i</b> is used as the root class for a number of FM MKSynthPatches.
It supports a wide variety of parameters, including many MIDI parameters.
It supports a wide variety of parameters, including many MIDI parameters.

See the FM literature for details of FM synthesis.  
(Note that the implementation here is "frequency modulation" rather than 
"phase modulation" and that the deviation scaling does not follow the  
frequency envelope -- it is exactly as defined in the literature only  
when the frequency envelope is at 1.  

When using this MKSynthPatch in an interactive real-time context, such as playing
from a MIDI keyboard, call <b>MKUseRealTimeEnvelopes()</b> before allocating the
MKSynthPatch.

<h2>Parameter Interpretation</h2>

<b>afterTouch</b> - MIDI afterTouch (also called channel pressure) attenuates
the  amount of frequency modulation.  In the range 0:127.  A value of 127 (the
default) produces no attenuation.

<b>afterTouchSensitivity</b> - Controls the amount of attenuation caused by
afterTouch.  If afterTouchSensitivity is 1.0 and afterTouch is 0, modulation is
0.  If afterTouchSensitivity is .5 and afterTouch is 0, modulation is half the
normal amount.  Default sensitivity is 0.5.  

<b>ampEnv</b> - Amplitude envelope.  Default is an envelope that is always a
constant 1.0.

<b>amp</b> - Amplitude.  In the range 0.0:1.0.  amp1 is a synonym for amp. 
Default is 0.1.

<b>amp0</b> - Amplitude when the envelope is at 0.0.  amp is amplitude when the
envelope is at 1.0.  amp1 is a synonym for amp.  Default is 0.0.

<b>ampAtt</b> - Time of attack portion of envelope in seconds.  If this
parameter is not present, the times in the envelope are used
verbatim.

<b>ampRel</b> - Time of release portion of envelope in seconds.  If this
parameter is not present, the times in the envelope are used
verbatim.

<b>bearing</b> - Left/right panning of signal.  In range -45.0:45.0.  -45.0 is
far left.  Default is 0.0.

<b>bright</b> - Brightness, a multiplier on fm index.  Defaults to
1.0.

<b>controlChange</b> - This parameter is the MIDI controller number to be
affected.  It is used in conjunction with the parameter controlVal, which
provides the value the controller is set to.  This SynthPatch uses MIDI volume
(controller 7) to adjust output volume as an attenuation of the final output
signal.  The default for MIDI volume is 127.

<b>controlVal</b> - See controlChange.

<b>cRatio</b> - Carrier frequency scaler.  The resulting carrier frequency is
cRatio multiplied by the freq parameter (or the frequency derived from the
keyNum parameter).  c1Ratio is a synonym.  Default is 1.0.

<b>freq</b> - Frequency in Hz.  freq1 is a synonym for freq.  Default is
A440.

<b>freqEnv</b> - Frequency envelope.  Default is an envelope that is always a
constant 1.0.

<b>freq0</b> - Fundamental frequency when the envelope is at 0.  freq is
frequency when the envelope is at 1.  freq1 is a synonym for freq.  Default is
0.0.

<b>freqAtt</b> - Time of attack portion of envelope in seconds.  If this
parameter is not present, the times in the envelope are used
verbatim.

<b>freqRel</b> - Time of release portion of envelope in seconds.  If this
parameter is not present, the times in the envelope are used
verbatim.

<b>keyNum</b> - The MIDI key number, an alternative to freq.  If both freq and
keyNum are present, freq, takes precedence.  In the range 0:127.

<b>m1Ind</b> - Modulation index.  If an envelope, is specified, this is the
index when the envelope is at 1.  <b>m1Ind1</b> is synonym for <b>m1Ind</b>. 
Default is 2.0.

<b>m1IndEnv</b> - Modulation index envelope.  Default is a constant value of
1.0.

<b>m1Ind0</b> - Modulation index when envelope is at 0.0.  <b>m1Ind</b> is index
when envelope is at 1.0.  Default is 0.0.

<b>m1IndAtt</b> -Time of attack portion of envelope in seconds.  If this
parameter is not present, the times in the envelope are used
verbatim.

<b>m1IndRel</b> - Time of release portion of envelope in seconds.  If this
parameter is not present, the times in the envelope are used
verbatim.

<b>m1Ratio</b> - Modulator frequency scaler.  The resulting modulator frequency
is m1Ratio multiplied by the freq parameter.  Default is 1.0.

<b>m1Phase</b> - Initial phase in degrees of modulator wavetable.  Rarely
needed.  Default is 0.0.

<b>m1Waveform</b> - Modulator wave table. Default produces a sine wave.  If you
specify a MKSamples object to an FM MKSynthPatch, the length may be any power of
2.

<b>phase</b> - Initial phase of wavetable in degrees.  Rarely needed.  Default
is 0.0.

<b>pitchBend</b> - Modifies frequency (or keyNum) as a 14 bit integer.  A value
of MIDI_ZEROBEND (defined as 0x2000 in &lt;mididriver/midi_spec.h&gt;) gives no 
bend.  0 is maximum negative bend.  0x3fff is maximum positive bend.  See
MKTuningSystem class for details.  May give unexpected results when combined with
frequency envelopes.  Default is MIDI_ZEROBEND.

<b>portamento</b> - Portamento time.  In a phrase, the transition time to a note
from the immediately preceding note.  Overrides the time values of the first
segment of the envelopes.  Note that portamento is applied after the attack-time
parameters.

<b>velocity</b> - A MIDI parameter.  In range 0:127.  The default is 64. 
Velocity scales amplitude by an amount deteremined by velocitySensitivity.  Some
SynthPatches also scale brightness or FM index based on velocity. 

<b>velocitySensitivity</b> - In range 0.0:1.0.  Default is 0.5.  When
velocitySensitivity is 0, velocity has no effect.
<b>pitchBendSensitivity</b> - A value of 0.0 means pitchBend has no effect.  A
value of 1.0 means pitch bend corresponds to plus or minus a semitone.  Larger
values give larger pitch deviation.  Default is 3.0.

<b>waveform</b> - WaveTable used for the oscillator (only the carrier, in the
case of FM).  Defaults to sine.  Note that the WaveTable you supply is
normalized so that its peak amplitude is 1.0.

<b>waveLen</b> - Length of wavetable.  Defaults to an optimal value.  May only
be set at the start of a phrase or with a noteUpdate that has no
noteTag.
