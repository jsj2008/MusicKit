  @brief Single-oscillator wavetable producing periodic waveforms using a non-interpolating
  oscillator.   
  
<b>Simp</b> is a single-oscillator wavetable MKSynthPatch, capable of producing
any periodic waveform.  It is the simplest of the Music Kit MKSynthPatches.    It
uses a non-interpolating oscillator, which means it is not particularly high
quality.  

For most musical applications, it is preferable to use <b>Wave1</b> or
<b>Wave1i</b>, both of which feature amplitude and frequency
envelopes.

When using this MKSynthPatch in an interactive real-time context, such as playing
from a MIDI keyboard, call <b>MKUseRealTimeEnvelopes()</b> before allocating the
MKSynthPatch.

<h2>Parameter Interpretation</h2>

<b>amp</b> - Amplitude.  In the range 0.0:1.0.  amp1 is a synonym for amp. 
Default is 0.1.

<b>bearing</b> - Left/right panning of signal.  In range -45.0:45.0. -45.0 is
far left.  Default is 0.0.

<b>controlChange</b> - This parameter is the MIDI controller number to be
affected.  It is used in conjunction with the parameter controlVal, which
provides the value the controller is set to.  This MKSynthPatch uses MIDI volume
(controller 7) to adjust output volume as an attenuation of the final output
signal.  The default for MIDI volume is 127.

<b>controlVal</b> - See controlChange.

<b>freq</b> - Frequency in Hz.  freq1 is a synonym for freq.  Default is
A440.

<b>keyNum</b> - The MIDI key number, an alternative to freq.  If both freq and
keyNum are present, freq, takes precedence.  In the range 0:127.

<b>pitchBend</b> - Modifies frequency (or keyNum) as a 14 bit integer.  A value
of MIDI_ZEROBEND (defined as 0x2000 in &lt;mididriver/midi_spec.h&gt;) gives no 
bend.  0 is maximum negative bend.  0x3fff is maximum positive bend.  See
TuningSystem class for details.  Default is MIDI_ZEROBEND.

<b>pitchBendSensitivity</b> - A value of 0.0 means pitchBend has no effect.  A
value of 1.0 means pitch bend corresponds to plus or minus a semitone.  Larger
values give larger pitch deviation.  Default is 3.0.

<b>waveform</b> - WaveTable used for the oscillator (only the carrier, in the
case of FM).  Defaults to sine.  Note that the WaveTable you supply is
normalized so that its peak amplitude is 1.0.

<b>waveLen</b> - Length of wavetable.  Defaults to an optimal value.  May only
be set at the start of a phrase or with a noteUpdate that has no
noteTag.

<b>phase</b> - Initial phase of wavetable in degrees.  Rarely needed.  Default
is 0.0.

<b>velocity</b> - A MIDI parameter.  In range 0:127.  The default is 64. 
Velocity scales amplitude by an amount deteremined by velocitySensitivity. 


<b>velocitySensitivity</b> - In range 0.0:1.0.  Default is 0.5.  When
velocitySensitivity is 0, velocity has no effect.
