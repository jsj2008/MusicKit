  @class SndMeter
  @brief Not ready for operation just yet!
  
  

A SndMeter is a view that displays the amplitude level of a sound as
it's being recorded or played back. There are two working parts to the
meter: A continuously-updated &ldquo;running bar&rdquo; that lengthens
ands shrinks to depict the current amplitude level, and a &ldquo;peak
bubble&rdquo; that displays and holds the greatest amplitude that was
detected within the last few samples. An optional bezeled border is
drawn around the object's frame.

To use a SndMeter, you must first associate it with a Snd object,
through the <b>setSound:</b> method, and then send the SndMeter a
<b>run:</b> message. To stop the meter's display, you send the object
a <b>stop:</b> message. Neither <b>run:</b>nor <b>stop:</b> affect the
performance of the meter's sound.

You can retrieve a SndMeter's running and peak values through the
<b>floatValue</b> and <b>peakValue</b> methods. The values that these
methods return are valid only while the SndMeter is running. A
SndMeter also keeps track of the minimum and maximum amplitude over
the duration of a run; these can be retrieved through <b>minValue</b>
and <b>maxValue</b>. All SndMeter amplitude levels are normalized to
fit between 0.0 (inaudible) and 1.0 (maximum amplitude).
