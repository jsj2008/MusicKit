@class SndPerformance
@brief  Holds the state associated with each sounding (or soon to be) Snd.

  This differs from a Snd instance itself, since we can have multiple overlapping
  simultaneous performances of the same (potentially huge) Snd, some looping, others not.
  We need some way of indicating to the delegate exactly which performance has completed,
  hence this class. A SndPerformance also has an SndAudioProcessorChain enabling each performance
  of a sound to be signal processed, including volume fading, panning etc using the audio
  processor chain "postFader" SndAudioFader.
