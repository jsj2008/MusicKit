%description 
The SndKit is a set of Objective-C classes which give a high-level representation
of audio data. The SndKit is able to read and write soundfiles in many different
formats, and can play and record audio on MacOSX, Win32 and various *nix implementations
via GNUstep, with OSS or ALSA with OSS emulation. The underlying audio streaming mechanism
is based on portaudio, and is found in the MKPerformSndMIDI package, which is a
pre-requisite to this package.

# create the specfile from this file with "make specfile", or the whole
# rpm in a oner with "RPM_TOPDIR=/usr/src/redhat make rpm" (as root).
