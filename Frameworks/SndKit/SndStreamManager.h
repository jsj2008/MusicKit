  @brief   Sends messages from any thread to any object in the main thread
  
  This method was introduced to allow easy delegate messaging from
  the underlying audio threads, but can be used by any object. The
  method creates an NSInvocation out of the parameters given, and
  adds it to an array of waiting messages. Then a background thread
  with an NSConnection to the main thread is notified, and the messages
  are passed up the connection one by one, and dispatched in the main
  thread. Note that the final dispatch is only done as part of the
  application's NSRunLoop, which means that if the main thread is busy
  doing anything, it can tke a little while for the delegate message to
  appear. Even if this is the case, this method should not block for long.
