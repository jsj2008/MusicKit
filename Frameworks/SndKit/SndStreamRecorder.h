  @class SndStreamRecorder
  @brief Records incoming audio to a sound file.
    
    ATTENTION!!!
      Presumptions made to get this class off the ground quickly: The incoming
      stream is made of 32-bit floats, and the saved file is made of 16-bit ints!

    BIG TODO: general purpose format stuff 

      Using the client currently requires an explicit connect-to-stream manager
      call:
 
    SndStreamRecorder *rec = [SndStreamRecorder streamRecorder];
    [[SndStreamManager defaultStreamManager] addClient: rec];
 
    then either...
 
    [rec startRecordingToFile: "/tmp/incomingsound.snd"];
    (time passes...)
    [rec stopRecording];
 
    or:

    [rec prepareForRecording: 10.5]; //record for 10.5 seonds
    [rec startRecording];

    TODO:
    - Obviously the big todo here is to get general purpose stream and file
      or format conversion happening!
    - Also, output is currently buffered + written (in stream-to-file mode) in
      44100-frame chunks; this should be more general.
    - delegate call-backs to say recording has started / ended, what incoming
      levels are like, etc
