  @class SndMP3
  @brief SndMP3 is a subclass of Snd for reading MP3 files.
  
  Decoding of MP3 sound files can be done in a background thread during reading (predecoding),
  or on-the-fly during playback, allowing selection of memory consumption versus processor load.
  Decoding on the fly has the advantage of memory conservation, but is more processor intensive.
  The factory methods +preDecode and +setPreDecode: are used to control the use of on-the-fly MP3
  sound file decoding or to use the pre-decoding approach.

  The current on-the-fly version has the limitation that it only works with CBR (constant bit rate) MP3 streams.
  
  Support is only for 44.1KHz stereo MP3s at the moment.

  @brief Sets whether to do background predecoding when reading an MP3 file or whether decoding is done on the fly.
  
  When an MP3 file is read, <i>predecoding</i> of the MP3 bitstream to linear PCM can be done in the background.
  This is significantly more memory hungry than decoding the MP3 stream on the fly, but less processor intensive,
  moving the decoding processing before playback or other signal processing.
  
  Decoding on the fly currently has the limitation that only one MP3 stream can play at any time. This limitation
  is being worked on.
  
  The default is to decode on the fly.
  
  @param yesOrNo YES to enable background predecoding, NO to decode on the fly.

  @brief Copies samples from self into a sub region of the provided SndAudioBuffer.
  
  If the buffer and the SndMP3 instance have different formats (after decoding the MP3 bitstream),
  a format conversion will be performed to the buffers format, including resampling
  if necessary. The SndMP3 audio data will be read enough to fill the range of samples
  specified according to the sample rate of the buffer compared to the sample rate
  of the SndMP3 instance. In the case where there are less than the needed number of
  samples left in the sndFrameRange to completely insert into the specified buffer region, the
  number of samples inserted will be returned less than bufferRange.length. 
 
  Caching is performed so repeatedly retrieving the same frame successively incurs no decoding overhead.

  in the bufferRange if sndStartIndex is less than the number samples needed to convert to
