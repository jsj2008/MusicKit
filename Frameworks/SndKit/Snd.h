@class Snd
@brief The Snd object encapsulates a sounds format parameters and it's sample data.
          It supports reading and writing to a soundfile, playback of sound,
          recording of sampled sound, conversion among various sampled formats, 
          basic editing of the sound, and name and storage
          management for sounds.

Snd objects represent and manage sounds. A Snd object's sound can be
recorded from a microphone, read from a sound file or NSBundle
resource, retrieved from the pasteboard or from the sound segment in
the application's executable file, or created algorithmically. The Snd
class also provides an application-wide name table that lets you
identify and locate sounds by name.

Playback and recording are performed by background threads, allowing
your application to proceed in parallel. By using preemption of queueing,
the latency between sending a <b>play:</b> or <b>record:</b> message and
the start of the playback or recording, is no more than the duration of
one hardware buffer. A Snd holds parameters that prime it's performance
at the start of play including a SndAudioProcessor for effects processing,
volume and panning.

You can also edit a Snd object by adding and removing samples. To
minimize data movement (and thus save time), an edited Snd may become
fragmented; in other words, its sound data might become discontiguous
in memory. While playback of a fragmented Snd object is transparent,
it does incur some overhead. If you perform a number of edits you may
want to return the Snd to a contiguous state by sending it a
<b>compactSamples</b> message before you play it. However, a large Snd
may take a long time to compact, so a judicious and well-timed use of
<b>compactSamples</b> is advised. Fragmented Snds are automatically
compacted before they're copied to a pasteboard (through the
<b>writeToPasteboard:</b> method). Also, when you write a Snd to a
sound file, the data in the file will be compact regardless of the
state of the object.

A Snd object contains a SndSoundStruct, the structure that describes
and contains sound data and that's used as the sound file format and
the pasteboard sound type. Most of the methods defined in the Snd
class are implemented so that you needn't be aware of this
structure.


<H3>Sound Conversion Features</H3>

The sample rate conversion routines (in particular) come from Julius Smith
(resample-1.2), but have been modified to not require compacting of fragmented
sound files. Additionally, they will accept 8 bit, float and double input,
although the output is always 16 bit. So although you can convert sampling
rates of float data, it has to go through an intermediate 16 bit
stage for the rate conversion. Sorry.

There are 3 different qualities of sample rate conversion, described by SndConversionQuality.
The fastest conversion is of the lowest quality. The Snd object uses the fastest one by default, but you
can set the quality to be used with the -setConversionQuality: method.

The sound conversion routines (in general) basically convert from any
sampling rate, any number of channels (<= 16), 8, 16 bit, float and double
formats to any other combination of the above, in as
few passes as possible. When changing numbers of channels, you can change
from 1 to many, many to 1, or any power of 2 to any other power of 2
(eg 2 to 8, 4 to 2, 2 to 16 etc).
