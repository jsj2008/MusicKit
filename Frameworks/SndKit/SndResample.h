Description of constants:
</p><p>
 <b>Npc</b> - is the number of look-up values available for the lowpass filter
  between the beginning of its impulse response and the "cutoff time"
  of the filter.  The cutoff time is defined as the reciprocal of the
  lowpass-filter cut off frequence in Hz.  For example, if the
  lowpass filter were a sinc function, Npc would be the index of the
  impulse-response lookup-table corresponding to the first zero-
  crossing of the sinc function.  (The inverse first zero-crossing
  time of a sinc function equals its nominal cutoff frequency in Hz.)
  Npc must be a power of 2 due to the details of the current
  implementation. The default value of 512 is sufficiently high that
  using linear interpolation to fill in between the table entries
  gives approximately 16-bit accuracy in filter coefficients.
</p><p>
 <b>Nhc</b> - is log base 2 of Npc.
</p><p>
 <b>Na</b> - is the number of bits devoted to linear interpolation of the
  filter coefficients.
</p><p>
 <b>Np</b> - is Na + Nhc, the number of bits to the right of the binary point
  in the integer "time" variable. To the left of the point, it indexes
  the input array (X), and to the right, it is interpreted as a number
  between 0 and 1 sample of the input X.  Np must be less than 16 in
  this implementation.
</p><p>
 <b>Nh</b> - is the number of bits in the filter coefficients. The sum of Nh and
  the number of bits in the input data (typically 16) cannot exceed 32.
  Thus Nh should be 16.  The largest filter coefficient should nearly
  fill 16 bits (32767).
</p><p>
 <b>Nb</b> - is the number of bits in the input data. The sum of Nb and Nh cannot
  exceed 32.
</p><p>
 <b>Nhxn</b> - is the number of bits to right shift after multiplying each input
  sample times a filter coefficient. It can be as great as Nh and as
  small as 0. Nhxn = Nh-2 gives 2 guard bits in the multiply-add
  accumulation.  If Nhxn=0, the accumulation will soon overflow 32 bits.
</p><p>
 <b>Nhg</b> - is the number of guard bits in mpy-add accumulation (equal to Nh-Nhxn)
</p><p>
 <b>NLpScl</b> - is the number of bits allocated to the unity-gain normalization
  factor.  The output of the lowpass filter is multiplied by LpScl and
  then right-shifted NLpScl bits. To avoid overflow, we must have 
  Nb+Nhg+NLpScl < 32.
