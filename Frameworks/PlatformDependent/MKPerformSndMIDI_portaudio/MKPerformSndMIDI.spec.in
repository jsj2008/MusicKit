%description
This package contains MKPerformSndMIDI, the audio streaming mechanism underlying
SndKit and MusicKit. It is based on portaudio, the cross-platform audio I/O toolkit
(http://www.portaudio.com). The GNUStep implementation of MKPerformSndMIDI does not
yet support MIDI, but this support will appear in a future version.
