  Description:
    Simple oscillator with no envelopes.
    classgroup Oscillators and Waveform Generators

    OscgUG  - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/oscg.asm (see source for details).

    OscgUG<a><b>, where <a> is output space and <b> is table space.

    This is a non-interpolating oscillator. That means that its fidelity
    depends on the size of the table (larger tables have lower distortion)
    and the highest frequency represented in the table. For high-quality
    synthesis, an interpolating oscillator is preferable. However, an
    interpolating oscillator is also more expensive. OscgUG is useful
    in cases where density of texture is more important than fidelity of
    individual sounds.

    The wavetable length must be a power of 2.
    The wavetable increment must be nonnegative.

  @brief <b>OscgUG</b> is the basic oscillator and supports amplitude and frequency as memory arguments.
  
  

This is a non-interpolating oscillator. That means that its fidelity depends on
the size of the table (larger tables have lower distortion) and the highest
frequency represented in the table.  For high-quality synthesis, an
interpolating oscillator, such as OscgafiUG is preferable.  However, an
interpolating oscillator is also more expensive, in terms of DSP cycles.  OscgUG
is useful in cases where density of texture is more important than fidelity of
individual sounds.
  
Restrictions:  The wavetable length must be a power of 2. The wavetable
increment must be nonnegative.

  <i>anObj</i> can be a
  MKSynthData object or a MKWaveTable (MKPartials or MKSamples).
  
  This method first releases its claim on the locally-allocated MKSynthData, if any.  (see below).
 Then, if <i>anObj</i> is a MKSynthData object, the SynthData object is used directly.
 If <i>anObj</i> is a MKWaveTable, the receiver first searches in its MKOrchestra's shared object table to see
 if there is already an existing MKSynthData based  on the same MKWaveTable, of the same length, and in the
 required memory space.  Otherwise, a local MKSynthData object is created and installed in the shared object
 table so that other unit generators running simultaneously may share it.
 If the requested size is too large, because there is not sufficient DSP memory, smaller sizes are tried.
 You can determine what size was used by sending the tableLength message. If <i>anObj</i> is nil, this method
 simply releases the locally-allocated MKSynthData, if any.  
  
  Note that altering the contents of a MKWaveTable will have no effect once it  has been installed,
 even if you call <b>setTable:length:</b> again after  modifying the MKWaveTable. The reason is that the 
 MKOrchestra's shared data  mechanism finds the requested object based on its <b>id</b>, rather than its contents.
  
  You should not free MKWaveTables used as arguments to OscgUG until the performance is over.
  
  If the table is not a power of 2, returns nil and generates the error MK_ugsPowerOf2Err.

  @brief This method is provided as a convenience.

  It tries to do 'the right
  thing' in cases where the table cannot be allocated.
  
  If the table can be allocated, it behaves like <b>setTable:length:</b>.
	  If the table cannot be allocated, and the table memory space of the receiver is Y,
  sends <b>[self setTableToSineROM].</b> 
  
  A common use of this method is to pass YES as the argument <i>yesOrNo</i> only
  if the MKSynthPatch is beginning a new phrase (the assumtion is that it is
	  better to keep the old wavetable than to use the sine ROM in this case).
  Another use of this method is to specifically request the sine ROM by passing <b>nil</b>
  as <i>anObj</i>.  If the sine ROM is used, the <i>aLength</i> argument is ignored.
  
  If <i>anObj</i> is not <b>nil</b> and the sine ROM is used, generates the error
  <b>MK_spsSineROMSubstitutionErr</b>. If <i>yesOrNo</i> is YES but the receiver's 
  table memory space is X, the error <b>MK_spsCantGetMemoryErr</b>  is generated.
