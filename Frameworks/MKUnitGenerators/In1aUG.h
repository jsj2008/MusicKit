  Description:
    In1aUG - from dsp macro /usr/local/lib/dsp/ugsrc/in1a.asm (see source for details).

    In1a reads its input signal from channel 0 (left) of the stereo sound input sample 
    stream of the DSP, writing it to its output. 
    In1a also provides a scaling on its output.

    You instantiate a subclass of the form 
    In1aUG<a>, where <a> = space of input

  @class In1aUG
  @brief <b>In1aUG</b> reads sound from the left channel of DSP serial port and writes it
  to its output patchpoint.
  
  

In1aUG and In1bUG provide single-channel access to the DSP's stereo input
stream, which comes from the DSP serial port; the former reads its input signal
from the left channel, and the latter reads from the right. 

In order to use an In1aUG or In1bUG, you must first send the message
<b>setSerialSoundIn:YES</b> to the Orchestra.  This must be done before the
Orchestra is sent the <b>open</b> message.  

If you're building a SynthPatch subclass, you should note that every SynthPatch
object should have its own signal-input UnitGenerator; in other words, you don't
allocate just one such object and then share it amongst the various
SynthPatches.  The input signal is sent to all the In1aUGs and
In1bUGs.
