  Description:
    BiquadUG.h - Two-pole, two-zero, filter section, with gain.

    The BiquadUG unit-generator implements a two-pole, two-zero filter
    section in direct form.  The output space can only be y DSP memory.
    Therefore, only two leaf classes exist, BiquadUGx and BiquadUGy,
    corresponding to the two possible input spaces.

    The biquad transfer function is

                             -1         -2
                 1  +  b1 * z   + b2 * z
      H(z) = g * -------------------------
                             -1         -2
                 1  +  a1 * z   + a2 * z

    The biquad difference equation which implements H(z) is

     v(n) = g * x(n) - a1 * v(n-1) - a2 * v(n-2);
     y(n) =     v(n) + b1 * v(n-1) + b2 * v(n-2);

    where n denotes the current sample time, x(n) is the input signal at
    time n, y(n) is the output signal, and v(n) is an intermediate signal
    between the poles section and the zeros section.  This is the
    so-called direct-form digital filter structure, which follows
    immediately from the transfer function definiteion.  In the DSP, which
    uses fixed-point arithmetic, the so-called "transposed direct form" is
    used instead to avoid the possibility of internal overflow of v(n).
    However, the transfer function is equivalent. See Digital Signal
    Processing by A.V. Oppenheim and R.W.  Schafer (Prentice-Hall, 1975,
    p. 155) for further discussion.

    You instantiate a subclass of the form 
    BiquadUG<a><b>, where <a> = space of output and <b> = space of input.

  @class BiquadUG
  @brief <b>BiquadUG</b> is a two-pole, two-zero filter useful for adding resonances. 
  
The <b>BiquadUG</b> unit-generator implements a two-pole, two-zero filter
section in direct form.  The output space can only be <i>y</i> DSP memory.   
Therefore, only two leaf classes exist, <b>BiquadUGx</b> and <b>BiquadUGy</b>,
corresponding to the two possible input spaces.

The biquad transfer function is

<pre>
                        -1         -2
            1  +  b1 * z   + b2 * z
H(z) = g * -------------------------
                        -1         -2
            1  +  a1 * z   + a2 * z
</pre>

The biquad difference equation which implements H(z) is

<pre>
v(n) = g * x(n) - a1 * v(n-1) - a2 * v(n-2);
y(n) =  v(n) + b1 * v(n-1) + b2 * v(n-2);
</pre>

where n denotes the current sample time, x(n) is the input signal at time n,
y(n) is the output signal, and v(n) is an intermediate signal.  This is the
so-called "transposed direct form II" digital filter structure, which
avoids the possibility of internal overflow. See Digital Signal
Processing by A.V. Oppenheim and R.W. Schafer (Prentice-Hall, 1975,
p. 155) for further discussion.
