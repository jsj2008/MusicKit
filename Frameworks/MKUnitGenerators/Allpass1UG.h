  Description:
    Allpass1UG  - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/allpass1.asm. (see source for details)

   First order all pass filter.
	
   You allocate a subclass of the form Allpass1UG<a><b>, where 
   <a> = space of output and <b> = space of input.

   The allpass1 unit-generator implements a one-pole, one-zero
   allpass filter section in direct form. 

   The transfer function implemented is

		bb0 + 1/z
	H(z) =	---------
		1 + bb0/z

  @class Allpass1UG
  @brief <b>Allpass1UG</b> is a first-order all-pass filter, useful for phase modifications.

Allpass1UG is a one-pole, one-zero filter.  The value of the filter coefficient
is set directly.  The filter's transfer function is given as

<PRE>
        bb0 + 1/z	
H(z) =  ---------	
        1 + bb0/z
</PRE>

where bb0 is the filter coefficient.  Thus, the pole is at -bb0 and the zero is
at -1/bb0.  
 
In pseudo-C notation:

 <PRE>
 for (n = 0; n < I_NTICK; n++) {
    t = sinp:ainp[n] - bb0 * s;
    sout:aout[n] = bb0 * t + s;
    s = t;
 }
 </PRE>
 
The difference equation used to implement the filter in the DSP is:

<PRE>
y(n) = bb0 * x(n) + x(n-1) - bb0 * y(n-1); 
</PRE>

where x(n) denotes the input signal at time n, and y(n) is the output signal. 
This is the so-called &ldquo;direct-form-1&rdquo; digital filter structure.  It
has the property that the filter can only overflow if the output overflows. 
(In other words, <i>internal</i> overflow is not possible.)  For stability, bb0 must
lie between -1.0 and 1.0.

<h2>Optimization</h2>

Allpass1UG is fastest if the input memory space is x in which case three
inner-loop instructions are required.  Otherwise, four inner-loop instructions
are used.
