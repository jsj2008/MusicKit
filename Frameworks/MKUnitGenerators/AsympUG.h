	How Envelopes Are Used in the MusicKit SynthPatch Library 

In the MusicKit SynthPatch library, envelopes are specified in the
parameter list as some combination of an MKEnvelope object (a list of
time, value, and optional smoothing values), up to two value-modifying
numbers, and up to two time-scaling numbers.  See
<MKUnitGenerators/AsympUG.h> for details about the smoothing values in
an MKEnvelope.  The parameter names all begin with something descriptive
of their use, such as "amp" or "freq".  The MKEnvelope parameter has the
suffix "Env", e.g., "freqEnv".  The value-modifying parameters have
the suffixes "0" and "1", e.g., "freq0" and "freq1". The time-scaling
parameters have the suffixes "Att" and "Rel", e.g., "freqAtt" and
"freqRel".  In addition, just the descriptive part of the name may be
substituted for the "1"-suffix parameter, e.g. "freq" = "freq1".

	The MKEnvelope and Value-modifying Parameters

The synthpatches have been designed to allow several alternative ways
to use Envelopes, depending on the precise combination of these three
parameters. In the following paragraphs, the term "val0" stands for
any "0"-suffix numeric parameter, "val1" stands for any "1"-suffix
numeric parameter, "valAtt" stands for any "Att"-suffix parameter, and
"valRel" stands for any "Rel"-suffix parameter.

If no MKEnvelope is supplied, the desired value is specified in the
"val" field, (e.g. "freq") and the result is this value applied as a
constant. If an MKEnvelope is supplied but no "val0" or "val1" numbers
(e.g. "freqEnv" is supplied, but no "freq0" nor "freq1"), the MKEnvelope
values are used directly.  If only an MKEnvelope and "val0" are supplied,
the Envelope's y values are used after being added to "val0".  If only
an MKEnvelope and "val1" are supplied, the Envelope's y values are used
after being multipled by "val1".  If an MKEnvelope and both "val0" and "val1"
are supplied, the values used are "val0" plus the difference of "val1" and
"val0" multiplied by the MKEnvelope values.  In other words, the MKEnvelope
specifies the interpolation between the two numeric values.  "Val0"
specifies the value when the MKEnvelope is 0, and "val1" specifies the
value when the MKEnvelope is 1.

In mathematical terms, the formula for an MKEnvelope parameter val is then:
      
    DSP Value(t) = val0 + (val1 - val0) * valEnv(t)
       
where "val0" defaults to 0, "val1" defaults to 1, and "valEnv" defaults to a
constant value of 1 when only "val1" is supplied, and 0 otherwise.

	The MKEnvelope and Time-scaling Parameters

The "valAtt" and "valDec" numeric parameters directly affect the
"attack" and "decay" portions of an envelope, which are considered to
be the portions before and after the stickpoint, respectively.  When
supplied, the relevant portion of the envelope is scaled so that the
total time of that portion is the time specified in the parameter in
seconds.  For example, if valAtt is set to .5, the segments of the
portion of the envelope before the stick point will be proportionally
scaled so that the total time is .5 seconds.  The smoothing values are
also scaled proportionally so that the behavior of time-scaled
envelopes remains consistent.

ValAtt can only be set when an envelope is also supplied in the same note.
However, valDec may be set independently, e.g., in a noteOff where an
envelope was supplied in the preceeding noteOn.

	Phrases 

The MusicKit supports continuity between notes in a phrase.  When two
notes are part of the same phrase (they have the same time tag) or a
sounding note is updated by a noteUpdate, the envelope of the latter
note does not simply interrupt that of the earlier note.  Rather, the
first point of the latter envelope is ignored, and the envelope
proceeds directly to the second point, starting from wherever the
earlier envelope happens to be when the new noteOn occurs.  The time
it takes to do this is, by default, the time of the first segment of
the latter envelope, possibly affected by its "valAtt" parameter.
However, the "portamento" parameter may be used to specify the time
(in seconds) for the transition should take.  All of the x (time)
values of the envelope, except the first, are increased by the amount
needed to make the first segment take the desired amount of time. In
addition, the smoothing value for the first segment is adjusted
appropriately. 

The single "portamento" parameter affects all envelopes which the synthpatch
may be using.

MKUpdateAsymp() may be called with any of its arguments of type double 
"unset". "unset" is indicated by the value MAXDOUBLE. 

Caveat concerning FM:
  With the current (2.0) implementation of the FM family of MKSynthPatches, the
  amount of modulation (peak frequency deviation) is computed from freq1.
  That means that if you use the convention of putting the frequencies in the
  envelope itself and setting freq1 to 1, the index values will have to be 
  boosted by the fundamental frequency.

  @class AsympUG
  @brief <b>AsympUG</b> handles an MKEnvelope, passing it to the DSP one segment at a time
  and implementing asymptotic envelope segments.
  
AsympUG is an exponential (asymptotic) MKEnvelope handler that plays a MusicKit
MKEnvelope on the DSP. It is very similar to AsympenvUG and has almost the same
Objective C protocol. However, unlike AsympenvUG, which loads the entire
MKEnvelope into DSP memory, AsympUG feeds the MKEnvelope to the DSP one segment at a
time. This means AsympUG is more well-suited to very long Envelopes that would
not fit in DSP memory. For example, an entire piece may be specified as one long
MKEnvelope. AsympUG also uses less DSP code than AsympenvUG. However, AsympUG is
not well-suited to handling MKEnvelopes in interactive real-time applications,
such as playing a MIDI keyboard and hearing sound immediately. For such
applications, it is better to use AsympenvUG. 

AsympUG objects are normally used to provide dynamic scaling of a musical
attribute.  To this end, the output of an AsympUG is typically connected to the
frequency or amplitude input of an OscgafiUG object or used as input to an
InterpUG, Mul2UG, ScaleUG, etc. Although typically used to convey MKEnvelopes,
AsympUG may also be used as a simple exponential ramper, without an explicit
MKEnvelope object. Methods are provided that let you set the rate directly, or as
a time limit (referred to as  &ldquo;T60&rdquo;) that defines when the target will
have been perceptually reached.  

For each MKEnvelope segment, AsympUG creates an exponential signal that approaches
a limit (the &ldquo;target&rdquo;) at a particular rate, where the rate expresses
the precentage of the remaining journey that's taken with each step:
	
<i>output</i> = <i>previousOutput</i> + (<i>rate</i> * (<i>target - previousOutput</i>))	
<i>previousOutput</i> = <i>output</i>

For example, if the rate is 0.1 and the target is 1.0, the samples generated by
the AsympUG are
	
0.1, 0.19, 0.271, 0.343, 0.409, 0.4685, ...

Exponential envelopes have the advantage of being "self-limiting". That is, 
they seek their targets from any starting point. This allows for efficient
implementation of long connected MKEnvelope "phrases", one of the primary
advantages of the MusicKit's MKNote representation. In addition, if, for some
reason, the host processor gets a little bit behind, due to time-sharing, the
envelope will not continue unbounded toward disaster. 
 
MKEnvelope data is mapped onto the exponential representation as follows:

The MKEnvelope's yArray[n] is the target, considered to be in the infinite
future.The MKEnvelope's xArray[n] is the time of the right-hand side of the
segment (i.e. the time to interrupt the trajectory toward yArray[n]). The
MKEnvelope's smoothingArra[n] is the smoothing constant to get to yArray[n]. If
smoothingArra[n] is 0, the point  is reached immediately. If smoothingArra[n] is
1.0, the point is reached,  within about -48dB at the time of the next update.
If smoothingArra[n] is larger, the point is not reached within -48dB by the time
of the next update. A value of smoothingArra[n] of infinity will cause the
envelope to never change value. The first point, xArray[0], is assumed to be the
right-hand side of the non-existant first segment. yArray[0] is the initial
point (which may or may not be used, depending on the value of the instance
variable useInitialvalue (see below)). smoothingArra[0] is ignored. 

The envelope has a "stick point". When the envelope handler reaches the stick
point, it does not proceed to the next point until it receives the
<b>-finish</b> message. If there is no stick point, the <b>-finish</b> message
is ignored. If the envelope handler has not yet reached the stick point when the
<b>-finish</b> message is received, the envelope handler proceeds to the first
point after the stick point and continues from there.  Keep in mind that while
AsympUG uses the clockConductor (see Conductor Class Description) for timing of
envelope breakpoint values, <b>-finish</b> is sent based on the arrival of a
<b>noteOff</b> to the MKSynthPatch, which is (usually) managed by another
MKConductor.

MusicKit MKEnvelopes are usually associated with a set of parameters, such as
attackTime, releaseTime, etc. The C function <b>MKUpdateAsymp()</b> is provided
to conveniently manage setting the AsympUG's attributes according to a given
MKEnvelope and a set of Note parameters.  By using <b>MKUpdateAsymp()</b>, you
need only set the AsympUG's output patchpoint; all other methods are invoked for
you.  For more information, see the Class Description for the MKEnvelope
class.

A few other points to keep in mind: 

<ul>
<li>You should not change the contents of a MusicKit MKEnvelope object while
an AsympUG is using it.</li>
<li>The methods -<b>setYScale:yOffset:</b> and -<b>setReleaseXScale:</b> are
provided by AsympUG, but not by AsympenvUG.</li> 
<li>TransitionTime, which is specified in the method 
 -<b>resetEnvelope:yScale:yOffset:xScale:releaseXScale:funcPtr:transitionTime:</b>,
 is supported by AsympUG, but not by AsympenvUG.</li>
</ul>
