  Description:
    OnezeroUG  - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/onezero.asm (see source for details).

   You instantiate a subclass of the form OnezeroUG<a><b>, where 
   <a> = space of output and <b> = space of input.

   The onezero unit-generator implements a one-zero
   filter section in direct form.  For best performance,
   the input and output signals should be in separate
   memory spaces x or y.

  @class OnezeroUG
  @brief <b>OnezeroUG</b> is a one-zero (FIR) fiter useful for mild low and high-pass filtering.
  
  

OnezeroUG is a one-zero filter that's implemented by adding the previous input
sample (initialized as 0.0) to the current input sample:
	
<i>output</i>  = (<i>b0 * input</i>) + (<i>b1 * previousInput</i>)

<i>previousInput</i> = <i>input</i>

Note that the two samples have their own scalers:  

<ul>
<li><i>b0</i> scales the input sample; this is the gain of the filter. 
Effective gain values are between 0.0 and 1.0 (a negative gain is the same as
its absolute value, but with a 180 degree phase shift).
</li>

<li><i>b1</i> scales the previous input sample.  This is the filter's
coefficient:  If <i>b1</i> is less than 0.0, the OnezeroUG is a high-pass
filter; if it's greater than 0.0, the object is a low-pass filter.  For
stability, the value of <i>b1</i> should be between -1.0 and 1.0
(non-inclusive).
</li>
</ul>

Similar to the OnezeroUG is the OnepoleUG; it, too, is either a low-pass or a
high-pass filter, but the frequency roll-off is steeper than with a OnezeroUG. 
You should also note that the high-pass/low-pass determination with regard to
the sign of the coefficent is switched in the OnepoleUG.
