  Description:
    ConstantUG  - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/constant.asm (see source for details).

   Outputs a constant.
   
   You allocate one of the subclasses ConstantUG<a>, where <a> is the output 
   space. 

   Note that you ONLY need to use the ConstantUG if the patchpoint you're 
   writing will be overwritten by another UnitGenerator.  If you merely want
   to reference an unchanging constant, you do not need a ConstantUG; just
   allocate a SynthData and use its setToConstant: method.

   An example where the ConstantUG IS needed is in doing a reverberator.
   A global input patch point is published and the reverberator first reads
   this patchpoint, then sets it to 0 with a ConstantUG.  Then any 
   SynthPatches that write to the patchpoint add in to whatever's there.

  @brief <b>ConstantUG </b>simply writes a constant to its output patchpoint. 
  
ConstantUG produces a constant value.  Since you can set the value of a
patchpoint directly through the MKSynthData method <b>setToConstant:</b>, you
rarely need instances of this class.  However, a ConstantUG object can be used
to initialize, on each tick, a constant-valued patchpoint that may have been
written to during the previous tick.  For example, you can implement additive
synthesis by creating a patch in which each oscillator reads a patchpoint, adds
its own signal into the value, and then writes the sum back to the same
patchpoint in preparation for the next oscillator.  In this case, you would use
a ConstantUG to clear the patchpoint before the first oscillator reads it.
