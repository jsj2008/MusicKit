musickit_c directory

This directory contains an subset of the musicKit API implemented in C, as 
well as a number of demonstration waveguide patches that use the API. 

Here is a description of the contents of this directory. 

Makefile               - Makefile to build the unitGenerator library, 
                         the musickit subset and the example patch 
                         algorithms. On a NeXT system you can simply
                         type "make" to build the unitGenerators, the 
                         musickit_c, the patches, and to play the patches
            

mk_c.h                 - Subset of the musickit implemented in C
mk_sys.c
mk_sys.h
musickit_c.h
numerics.c
numerics.h

soundout.c           - These modules are currently setup to write NeXT
soundout.h             sound objects. This routine shoul be rewritten 
                       to support whatever sound file format that is 
                       native to the system that you are porting to. 

uglib                - Subdirectory that contains the unitGenerator library
