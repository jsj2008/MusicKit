  Description:
    Out1nUG - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/out1n.asm (see source for details).

    Out1n writes its input signal to the Nth channel of the output stream, which
    must be set up appropraitely.
    The stream is cleared before each DSP tick (each orchestra program 
    iteration). Out1n also provides a scaling on the output channel.
 
    You instantiate a subclass of the form 
    Out1nUG<a>, where <a> = space of input

  @brief <b>Out1nUG</b> may be used for quadraphonic and other multi-channel output.  
  
  

Out1aUG, Out1bUG and Out1nUG provide single-channel access to the DSP's stereo
output stream.  Out1aUG writes its input signal to the left channel, Out1bUG
writes to the right channel and Out1nUG allows the channel to be set with a
method.  To write a stereo signal, it may be more convenient to use a single
Out2sumUG object rather than one of each of these.  

Where the samples that are written to the DSP output stream are ultimately sent
- whether to sound-out, to the DSP serial port, or to a soundfile - depends on
the state of the MKOrchestra from which the Out1aUG, Out1bUG or Out1nUG object was
allocated.  By default, the MKOrchestra sends the samples to sound-out.

If you're building a MKSynthPatch subclass, you should note that every MKSynthPatch
object should have its own signal-output MKUnitGenerator; in other words, you
don't allocate just one such object and then share it amongst the various
MKSynthPatches.  The output signals produced by all the running Out1aUG's,
Out1bUG's, Out1nUG's and Out2sumUG's are mixed (added) together into the DSP's
output stream.

Out1nUG additionally makes possible quadraphonic (or other multi-channel)
output, with the proper external serial port device.  Additionally, the
orchestra must be set up as follows:
	
<tt>
[anOrch setSerialSoundOut:YES];	
[anOrch setSerialPortDevice:[[<i>QuadSerialPortDevice</i> alloc] init]];	
[anOrch open];
</tt>

where <i>QuadSerialPortDevice </i>is a custom subclass of <b>DSPSerialPortDevice</b>
that overrides the <b>-outputChannelCount</b> method to return 4 and overrides the
<b>-setUpSerialPort:</b> method to send the correct settings for the particular device.
