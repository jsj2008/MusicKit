  Description:
    Out2sumUG - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/out2sum.asm (see source for details).

   Out2sum writes its input signal to both channels of the stereo output 
   sample stream of the DSP, adding into that stream. 
   The stream is cleared before each DSP tick (each orchestra program 
   iteration). Out2sum also provides individual scaling on each output channel.
   The method setBearing: allows a convenient way to control the proportion
   of the signal sent to each channel.

   You instantiate a subclass of the form 
   Out2sumUG<a>, where <a> = space of input

  @class Out2sumUG
  @brief <b>Out2sumUG</b> sends its monaural input patchpoint to a stereo output stream,
  panning the sound as indicated by its memory arguments.
  
  

Out2sumUG adds its input signal to the DSP's stereo output stream.  The signal
is placed (or &ldquo;imaged&rdquo;) between the two channels according to the
value set through the <b>setBearing:</b> or <b>setBearing:scale:</b> method. 
Alternatively, you can set the gain of either channel independently, through the
<b>setRightScale:</b> and <b>setLeftScale:</b> methods. 

To write to just the left or just the right channel of the stereo ouput stream,
you should use an Out1aUG or Out1bUG object, respectively.  Where the samples
that are written to the DSP output stream are ultimately sent - whether to
sound-out or to a soundfile - depends on the state of the Orchestra from which
the Out1aUG or Out1bUG object was allocated.  By default, the Orchestra sends
the samples to sound-out.

If you're building SynthPatch subclasses, you should note that every SynthPatch
object should have its own signal-output UnitGenerator; in other words, you
don't allocate just one such object and then share it amongst the various
SynthPatches.  The output signals produced by all the running Out1aUG's,
Out1bUG's, and Out2sumUG's are mixed (added) together into the DSP's output
stream.
