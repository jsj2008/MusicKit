  @class TablookiUG
  @brief <b>TablookiUG</b> does interpolated table lookup, using its input as an index into the table.
  
TablookiUG does interpolated table-lookup.  It takes its input, which is
assumed to be between -1 and 1, scales it so that -1.0 maps onto the start of
the table and 1.0 maps onto the end of the table, then does a lookup and returns
the corresponding table value.  If the computed address is not an integer,
TablookiUG does linear interpolation between table values - thus, it gives a
high-quality mapping. 

To use it in a Waveshaping context, simply use an oscillator as the input to the
TablookiUG and set the TablookiUG's table to the appropriate distortion table. 
For an example, see the Waveshape MKSynthPatch in the Music Kit's MKSynthPatch
library.

<i>Note that the table size should be odd.</i>  This gives a symetrical table. 
For example, if the table size is 101, the point at 50 represents 0, there are
50 points corresponding to negative input (0-49, inclusive) and 50 points 
corresponding to positive input (51-100, inclusive).
