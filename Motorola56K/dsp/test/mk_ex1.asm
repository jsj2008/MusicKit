;; mk_ex1.asm - Test program for unit generator macro ramp
;;
;; Generate samples of a ramp.  When the program halts in Bug56, open an X
;; memory "space editor", set loLimit to xsig (=4), and look for the numbers
;; 0 through $F in the ouput vector x:4..$13.
;;
;; Note that Bug56 calls the breakpoint "undefined" because it was not
;; set up within Bug56.  This is normal, so hit "Ok" to go on.
;;
;; Usage:
;;	asm56000 -A -B -L -OS,SO -I/usr/local/lib/dsp/smsrc/ mk_ex1
;; 		(or, simply "dspasm mk_ex1", to use the shell script provided)
;;	open /LocalDeveloper/Apps/Bug56.app
;;	<File / Load & erase symbols> mk_ex1.lod
;;	<sstep> or <run>
