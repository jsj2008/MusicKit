;;
;;  SYNOPSIS
;;      slpdur pf,ic,sout,aout0,val0,slp0,anslp0,dur0,andur0
;;
;;  MACRO ARGUMENTS
;;      pf    = global label prefix (any text unique to invoking macro)
;;      ic    = instance count (such that pf\_slpdur_\ic\_ is globally unique)
;;      sout  = output envelope memory space ('x' or 'y')
;;      aout0 = initial output address in memory sout (0 to $FFFF)

;;  DESCRIPTION
;;      The slpdur unit-generator computes piecewise-linear envelope
;;      functions specified by slope and duration tables in dsp memory.
;;      The envelope and its slope/duration specifications are single 
;;      precision values (24 bits).  The slope list must be in x memory
;;      and the duration list must be in y memory.
;;      
;;      The "slope" of each envelope segment is the actual 24-bit number which
;;      is added to the current envelope value to produce the next envelope
;;      value.
;;      
;;      The "duration" of each segment is the number of ticks (not samples) the
;;      current slope is added to the current value before going to the
;;      next envelope segment. When the duration is counted down to zero, the 
;;      next slope-duration pair is selected from the envelope slope-duration
;;      tables.
;;      
;;      The last envelope segment is followed by a "dummy" envelope segment
;;      having a negative duration:
;;      
;;       END-SEGMENT
;;        DURATION          MEANING
;;      ------------        -------
;;      -1 ($FFFFFF)        Decay exponentially to zero 
;;      -2 ($FFFFFE)        Remain at current value
;;      
;;      The -1 duration means to decay exponentially to zero using the decay
;;      constant passed in the slope argument of the dummy end-segment. That
;;      is, if the end-slope is 0.99, the current envelope is drecreased by 
;;      0.99 EVERY OTHER sample (until the envelope is re-initialized) 
;;      providing an exponential decay to zero (time constant = 2/(1-0.99) 
;;      = 200 samples). If A is the envelope value at the beginning
;;      of an exponential decay, and the decay constant is r, the output
;;      during the dummy segment is A, r*A, r*A, r*r*A, r*r*A, r^3*A, 
;;      r^3*A, etc.  The reason for decreasing every other sample instead
;;      of every sample (A, r*A, r^2*A, r^3*A, etc.) is in order to obtain
;;      one instruction in the DO loop for termination decay instead of two.
;;      There is apparently no way to obtain an exponential decay in a one-
;;      instruction DO loop because MPY cannot write its input registers.
;;      This means the sampling rate during the final exponential decay is
;;      reduced by half.  This should not be audible when sampling rates
;;      of 44.1KHz or 22.05KHz are used.
;;      
;;      The -2 duration means "stick" at the current value. It is
;;      equivalent to a zero slope and infinite duration. The actual slope
;;      argument is ignored.
;;      
;;      The envelope generator makes use of 5 dsp memory arguments to store its
;;      running state. These arguments hold
;;      
;;           current value        (envelope value)
;;      
;;           current slope            (for the segment in progress)
;;           next-slope pointer       (pointer to next element of slope table)
;;      
;;           remaining duration       (count-down for segment in progress)
;;           next-duration pointer    (pointer to next element of dur table)
;;      
;;      The envelope can be initialized, reset, or altered at any time by
;;      overwriting these arguments in dsp memory.  When the envelope reaches
;;      the end of a segment, it automatically advances the next-segment 
;;      pointers and updates the current-value and remaining-duration 
;;      to be those found in the next segment.  Thus, normally the envelope
;;      is initialized only once per instance.
;;      
;;      In addition to the running-state arguments, there is an output-vector
;;      argument which places the envelope samples. The envelope output
;;      (following usual unit-generator conventions) is a length I_NTICK
;;      signal vector addressed sequentially as sout:(R_O)+.
