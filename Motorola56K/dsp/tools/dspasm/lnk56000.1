.SH DESCRIPTION
.I lnk56000
is a program that processes relocatable link files produced
by the DSP56000 Macro Assembler, generating an absolute
load file which can be loaded directly into the DSP56000
Simulator or converted to Motorola S-record format for PROM
burning.
.LP
.I files
is a list of operating system compatible filenames (including optional
pathnames) separated by blanks.  If no extension is supplied for a given
file, the linker will automatically append
.I .lnk
to the filename.  If no
pathname is specified for a given file, the linker will look for that file
in the current directory.  The list of files will be processed sequentially in
the order given and all files will be used to generate the
load file and map listing.
.SH OPTIONS
Any of the following command line options may be specified.
These can be in any order,
but must precede the list of link filenames
(except for the \fB\-L\fR option).  Option letters may be
specified in either upper or lower case.
.IP \fB\-B\fR[<\fIlodfil\fR>]
This option specifies a name for the load file generated by
the linker.
.I lodfil
can be any legal operating system filename,
including an optional pathname.  Note that there can be no intervening
spaces between the 
.B \-B
and the optional filename.
.IP
If a pathname is not specified, the file will be created in the current
directory.  If no filename is specified, or if the
.B \-B
option is not given, the linker
will use the basename (filename without extension) of the first filename
encountered in the link input file list.  The resulting output file will
have an extension of \fI.lod\fR.  The 
.B \-B
option should be specified only once.
.IP \fB-D\fR
This option directs the linker to pass debug information such as line
number and symbol values through to the load file for use by a source
level debug program.  It is currently a no-op.
.IP \fB-L\fR[<\fIlibrary\fR>]
The linker ordinarily processes a list of link files which
each contain a single relocatable code module.  If the
\fB\-L\fR option is encountered, the linker treats the
following pathname as a \fIlibrary\fR file, and
\fIsearches\fR the file for any outstanding unresolved
references.  Note that there can be no intervening spaces
between the \fB\-L\fR and the library name.
.IP
If a module is found in the library that
resolves an outstanding external reference, the module is
read from the library and included in the load file output.
The linker continues to search a library until all external
references are resolved or no more references can be
satisfied within the current library.
The linker searches a library only once, when it is
encountered on the command line.  Therefore, the position of
the \fB\-L\fR option on the command line is significant.
.IP \fB-M\fR<\fImapfil\fR>
This option specifies that a map file is to be created.
.I mapfil
can be any legal operating system filename, including an
optional pathname.  Note that there can be no intervening spaces between
the 
.B -M
and the optional filename.
.IP
If a pathname is not specified, the file will be created in the current
directory.  If no filename is specified, the linker
will use the basename (filename without extension) of the first filename
encountered in the link input file list.  The resulting output file will
have an extension of \fI.map\fR.  If the 
.B -M
option is not specified,
then the linker will not generate a map file. The
.B -M
option should be specified only once.
.IP \fB-O\fR<\fImem\fR>[<\fIctr\fR>][<\fImap\fR>]:<\fIorigin\fR>
By default the linker generates instructions and data for
the load file beginning at absolute location zero for all
DSP56000 memory spaces.  This option allows
the programmer to redefine the start address for any memory
space and associated location counter. 
.IP
.I mem
is one of the single-character memory space identifiers (X,
Y, L, P).  The letter may be upper or lower case.
The optional
.I ctr
is a letter indicating the high (H) or low (L) location
counters.  If no counter is specified the default counter is
used.
.I map
is also optional and signifies the desired physical mapping
for all relocatable code in the given memory space.  It may
be I for internal memory, E for external memory, or B for
bootstrap memory (valid only in P program memory space).
If
.I map
is not supplied, then no explicit mapping is presumed.
.IP
The
.I origin
is a four-digit hexadecimal number in the range 0-FFFF
signifying the new relocation address for the given memory
space.  The \fB\-O\fR option may be specified as many times
as needed on the command line.  Note that there can be no
intervening spaces between the \fB\-O\fR and the memory space
specifier.
.IP \fB-R\fR<\fImemfil\fR>
This option indicates that a memory map file is to be read
to determine the absolute placement of sections in DSP56000
memory.
.I memfil
can be any legal operating system filename, including an
optional pathname.  Note that there can be no intervening spaces between
the 
.B -R
and the optional filename.
.IP
If a pathname is not specified, an attempt will be made to open 
the file in the current
directory.  If no filename is specified, the linker
will use the basename (filename without extension) of the first filename
encountered in the link input file list, appending
an extension of \fI.mem\fR.  If the 
.B -R
option is not specified,
then the linker will not use a memory map file. The
.B -R
option should be specified only once.
