This example illustrates playing a Music Kit scorefile on an external
MIDI synthesizer. It reads the scorefile from stdin and plays it 'on
the fly', i.e. as it is read.  This is analagous to the programming
example 'playscorefile2', which plays a scorefile on the DSP as it is
being read. An alternative is to first read the scorefile into a Score
object and then play it.

In the example program, the midi channel information for each part is gleaned
from the part 'info' statement in the scorefile. If none is found, all
notes go out on MIDI channel 1.
