playscorefile-qp, by David A. Jaffe.

This directory contains a version of the standard playscore programming
example, modified to play the music on the Ariel QuintProcessor 5-DSP
board.  To use this program, you need an Ariel QuintProcessor 
installed in slot 2, with an Ariel ProPort attached to the serial port
of DSP E.  You should set the ProPort's sampling rate adjustment to 0, 
"Auto 1".   You must be running release NeXTstep 3.0 and have the slot 
drivers correctly installed with the BusProbe application.

playscorefile-qp reads a scorefile from standard input.  By default,
it plays the file on the QuintProcessor.  If you want, you can also use the
NeXT DSP in addition to the 5 QuintProcessor DSPs--to do this, specify the
-n flag (which stands for "next").

playscorefile-qp allocates SynthPatches on the first available DSP.
Alternatively, you can specify on which DSP you want a Part's patches
allocated.  To do this, simply include an "orchestraIndex" parameter in the
Part's info in the scorefile.  For example:

	part myPart;
	myPart synthPatch:"Wave1vi" synthPatchCount:3 orchestraIndex:2;

This allocates 3 Wave1vi's on DSP 2 ('B') of the QuintProcessor.  The DSPs
are numbered as follows:

0   - NeXT DSP
1-4 - QuintProcessor "slave" or "satellite" DSPs
5   - QuintProcessor "hub" or "master" DSP

Note that you should not try to do as much synthesis with the hub as
with the satellites.  This is because the hub has the additional task
of merging the output of the 4 satellites.

The ProPort will automatically select the sampling rate you specify in the
scorefile's info statement.

The sampling rate can be any of the following:

48000, 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 11050, 5525

An example scorefile, qp-test.score, is provided.  To play it, simply type

	playscorefile-qp < qp-test.score
