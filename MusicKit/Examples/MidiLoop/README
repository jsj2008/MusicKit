This program takes MIDI through midi0 (serial port A on NeXT hardware)
and sends it out MIDI again. While this is a pointless application by
itself, it does demonstrate the simplest Music Kit MIDI application.
See the example MidiEcho for an example of more sophisticated MIDI
processing. MidiEcho also allows you to select which serial port to
use.
