This example program takes MIDI through serial port B and generates 
echoes on successive MIDI channels. Note that you must have a synthesizer 
capable of multi-channel synthesis plugged into the serial port to hear 
the echoes. You must also be sure to configure your synthesizer to respond
on MIDI channels 1-8.
