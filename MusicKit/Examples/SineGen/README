SoundTest2 is the sama as SoundTest but resets attenuation everytime the
run button is hit.  This allows the sound board to be reset.
*****************

This is like the SineGen example EXCEPT:

1. Speaker mute is forced off and speaker volume is forced full.

2. The attenuation slider control speaker volume, not sinewave amplitude.
