  Example Application within the MusicKit

  Description:
    This example program captures MIDI input in a scorefile.

    Each time you push the button a new MIDI recording session begins. The
    input is written to the file with the name specified in the graphic interface
    field.

    MidiRecord is an example of an interactive Music Kit performance.
    Therefore, the Conductor is clocked. The Conductor is also set to not
    'finishWhenEmpty'. This ensures the performance will continue, whether or
    not the Conductor has any Objective-C messages to send,
    until the user decides to terminate the performance. Finally, we set
    the MKMidi object to 'useInputTimeStamps' so that the times written to the
    output file are as precise as possible.
