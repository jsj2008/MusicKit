  Description:
    MidiPlay is an example of an interactive Music Kit performance.
    Therefore, the Conductor is clocked. The Conductor is also set to not 
    'finishWhenEmpty' to ensure the performance will continue, whether or 
    not the Conductor has any objective-c messages to send, 
    until the user decides to terminate the performance.  

    In this case, we are interested in a fast interactive response; 
    therefore, we set the delta time to a very small number (using 
    MKSetDeltaT()). 

    Beware that using very small delta times can cause some unpredictability. 
    You can cause your performance to be more predictable at the expense of 
    greater latency by increasing the delta time. You may also want to 
    experiment with untimed mode (see MKOrchestra.h), which can give better 
    response, but at the expense of decreased predictability. 

    MIDI pitch bend data is thinned out by sending it through a subclass of
    NoteFilter.

    Please note that the SynthPatches in the Music Kit SynthPatch library
    are not optimized for real time applications such as this one.
