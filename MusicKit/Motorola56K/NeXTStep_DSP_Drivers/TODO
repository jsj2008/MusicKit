Problems:

1. TB driver doesn't work with interrupts on

2. All drivers are slow doing write data


The following on frank with tb mkmon):

1. Extra 0 word before HOST_R_DONE

Dec 28 16:23:57 localhost mach: get data from dsp
Dec 28 16:23:57 localhost mach: DSP driver found 0 instead of HOST_R_DONE.
Dec 28 16:23:57 localhost mach: got data from dsp

Then...

Dec 28 16:23:57 localhost mach: Found 3,77,2!

2. Bogus port for DSP messages (should be port_null, right?)

Dec 28 16:23:57 localhost mach: Found 3,77,2!
Dec 28 16:23:57 localhost mach: DSP driver message not sent. ec: -102

3.
