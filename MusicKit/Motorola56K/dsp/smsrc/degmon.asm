; *** NeXT NOTES ***
;
; Several things have been changed from the original (by JOS):
;
;	(1) The assembly of vectors here was moved to ~dsp/smsrc/vectors.asm
;
;	(2) All ORG statements were removed so that this is one 
;	    contiguous piece of assembly.  It is positioned by
;	    ~dsp/smsrc/allocsys.asm which includes it.
;
;	(3) Name changes
;		The DE_ prefix was changed to DEGMON_
;		(I use "DE_" to prefix "DSP Error" codes)
;	 	The STACKERR label was changed to DEGMON_STACKERROR
;	 	The DEGMON entry label was changed to DEGMON_BEG
;
;	(4) Comments and code were reformatted to look better after (3,4) above
;
;	(5) Comments were suppressed from listing via changing ';' to ';;'
;
;	(6) Added HCR save/restore because HTIE must cleared and restored.
;	    Otherwise, "DSP messages" will go out while DEGMON is in control
;	    which will wreak havoc.
;
;	(7) "MOVEC SSH,SSL" was changed to "MOVEC SSH,P:DEGMON_FLAG2"

;
;
; This is a short and simple three-function monitor for the NeXT processor 
; card. The last two functions are callable from the NeXT by using Host
; commands.
;
; This version has been adapted for the NeXT. Note that the NeXT has no NMI
; input, so the NMI ISR is solely used as a host command. The RESET vector is 
; is used as a host command. HF2 and HF3 are BOTH set to indicate a breakpoint.
; These changes increase the monitor's size beyond the nominal 64 words.
;
;;The following is a list of the functions incorporated in the monitor:
;;
;;RESET HANDLER		Sets up interrupt modes, etc. Sends the starting 
;;			address and the length of DEGMON to the NeXT via the 
;;			host port. Enters "FREEZE" function to complete the
;;			initialization and execute command-loop. 
;;
;;
;;FREEZE	    (callable)	Halt user program execution
;;			The PC and SR of the interrupted process are saved as
;;			well as HSR and HSX (BOTH levels), then the function 
;;			waits in an endless loop. 
;;			
;;			While in this loop, any two word instruction seq-
;;			uence may be uploaded to 56001 program RAM and
;;			executed. This is done by setting HF1 TRUE or FALSE
;;			and then writing the two words from the NeXT to the 
;;			host port. Note that both words must be written,
;;			even if the second is a NOP.
;;
;;			If HF1 is TRUE after the second word was rcvd, then
;;			DEGMON waits for data to be present in the HRX and
;;			then executes the code. If HF1 is FALSE then
;;			DEGMON waits for the HTX to be empty and then
;;			executes the code. Note that this latter mode
;;			should be used if the uploaded instrs will not be
;;			using the host-port data.
;;			
;;NOTE 1:
;;			The instruction(s) should be position independent, 
;;			such as MOVEP X0,X:<<$FFEB  (X0 --> HTX)
;;			These commands are designed to be used to transfer
;;			data from the host port to a register or memory
;;			location (HF1 SET) or from a register or memory 
;;			location to the host port (HF1 CLEAR). See the 
;;			execution profile below for more info.
;;
;;NOTE 2:
;;			The FREEZE handler is also the TRACE, NMI and SWI 
;;			handler. Therefore, there is no need to waste a 
;;			"normal" host command vector (from $12 up) on another
;;			vector to FREEZE. Since host commands may be used to
;;			activate any interrupt, BUG56 uses the NMI vector to
;;			call the FREEZE exception.			
;;			
;;RUN/TRACE  (callable)	Runs a program beginning at a program counter address
;;			that has been saved in program memory. There is also
;;			a copy of the status register in program RAM. These
;;			may be manipulated by the NeXT by using uploaded instr-
;;			uctions as described above. 
;;			If the the Trace mode bit is set in the copy of the 
;;			SR then only one instruction is executed.
;;
;;	For the NeXT, the Host Command has been changed to HC0;; i.e., the 
;;	RESET vector. This was done to work better with NeXT's existing code.

;;===========================================================================
;;
;;The monitor reserves the following resources for itself:
;;
;;The two callable DEGMON functions use the NMI and RESET vectors.
;;
;;The first eight host command vectors are uninitialized and free for your own 
;;use. This means that DEGMON begins at $0034. If you need to use the six 
;;remaining host vectors between $0034 and $003E just reassemble DEGMON 
;;starting at a higher address.
;;
;;Note that since the HOST IPL is set to 2, ALL host commands have the same 
;;IPL. This means that lower-priority (IPL1 or 0) exceptions are masked.
;;Since the HOST IPL also applied to HOST INTERRUPTS for the HOST port data in
;;and out registers, these interrupts should NOT be used when trying to run
;;a program under the BUG56/DEGMON system (may not work very well). 
;;
;;Hardware reset interrupt vector. This enters a short init routine in the
;;beginning of DEGMON, sends the length and location of DEGMON to the NeXT. 
;;It then waits in an endless loop where it handles the uploading of two-word
;;instruction pairs sent from the NeXT. When you are through debugging, be sure
;;to install a reset vector for your program if it is running independently of
;;the monitor!
;;
;;The TRACE, SWI, and "reserved for H/W development" or NMI (at $001E) vectors
;;are all initialized to point to the FREEZE handler.
;;
;;HF3 (host flag 3). This is used so that DEGMON can inform the BUG56 debugger 
;;(running on the NeXT) that it has reached a breakpoint or a return from a 
;;TRACEed instruction. 
;;Otherwise BUG56 would not know whether data being transmitted via the host 
;;port (from the DSP to the NeXT) is something being done by the running 
;;program or an indication that the breakpoint was reached. If your program 
;;SETS this flag bit and then sends data to the NeXT via the host port then
;;incorrect operation of BUG56 will occur.
;;
;;This has been changed for the NeXT: now HF2 and HF3 are BOTH asserted.
;;
;;HF1 (host flag 1). This is used to communicate to the FREEZE routine.
;;
;;HF0 and HF2 are reserved for file I/O for the program being debugged.
;;
;;The STACK ERROR interrupt sets the input port flag at DEGMON_FLAG (in pgm ram)
;;to $00FFFF as a flag that the stack had overflowed. The stack pointer itself
;;is saved at DEGMON_HPD for your inspection, and is then set to zero. The PC
;;and SR at the time of the stack error are lost. The handler then branches into
;;the FREEZE routine.
;;
;;DEGMON uses program memory starting after the some host command vectors
;;(PRAM $0032: DEGMON then starts at $0034). 
;;Note that you can change that by modifying and reassembling DEGMON 
;;Reassembly may also be needed to add additional host command vectors 
;;above the eight that space is allocated for. If host commands are not used 
;;but you are running out of internal program RAM (and you do not want to use
;;external program RAM in order to maximize data memory) then all the 
;;extra  host commands (RUN) may be removed (they  have NOP place holders),
;;and DEGMON may be reassembled.
;;
;;BUG56 does not support placing DEGMON in external program RAM. It is of
;;course not possible to load external program RAM during the 56001's native
;;boot cycle.
;;
;;No data memory is used, anywhere.
;;===========================================================================
;;If the running or single-stepped program does something that keeps
;;host commands from being recognized then BUG56 will assert the NMI signal.
;; (NOT TRUE FOR NeXT)
;;
;;This will ALWAYS work as long as the interrupt vector at $1E is not
;;changed (not true for NeXT, no NMI). If it is changed, BUG56 will time out 
;;and the user must reset the DSP and reload the monitor.
;;
;;The success of this approach requires you to obey a few rules:
;;
;;1) The STOP instruction should not be used. BUG56 will probably have to
;;   reset the DSP if STOP is used.
;;2) The RESET instruction resets the host port IPL. This is recoverable 
;;   by using NMI.
;;3) Avoid IPL 2 for any interrupts in your program. Use IPL 0 or IPL 1. 
;;   For most programs two interrupt levels are sufficient. If you need to
;;   use IPL2, BUG56 may not work correctly, depending on the context. 
;;4) DEGMON may not work correctly if the host NeXT sets DMA mode on in the ICR.
;;   This will not occur when using BUG56 but you should be aware of this 
;;   when developing your own programs.
;;5) Don't change the interupt vectors reserved for DEGMON or disable host 
;;   port interrupts via the IPR bits 10,11.
;;6) Don't change the OMR bits 0 & 1 unless you want to "reboot" the 56001. 
;;7) If you read from or write to the stack using uploaded instructions
;;   be careful of the sequencing to avoid disturbing the stack.
;;
;;	READ SSL from DSP
;;	READ SSH from DSP
;;	modify SSL & SSH within the NeXT.
;;	WRITE SSH to the DSP
;;	WRITE SSL to the DSP
;;
;;   is the correct way to do it. This is because writing to SSH changes the
;;   stack pointer.
;;8) Keep in mind that DEGMON uses one level of stack!
;;   
;;
;;
;;FREEZE:	
;;	DEGMON: Host command initiated. Enter TRACE/NMI/SWI exception
;;		handler, which sets HF3 and waits. 
;;
;;	NeXT:	Set the CVR to $1E (NMI vector) | $80 = $9E
;;		Read and save any data that might have been in RX.
;;		Wait for the CVR bit 8 to be cleared. 
;;		Wait for HF3 to be SET (allow time for DEGMON to reset it).
;;		This means that the program has been frozen. 
;;
;;		If the CVR bit 8 does NOT reset, clear it. Check again for
;;		HF3 being set in case the command activated between the last
;;		time it was checked and the clearing of CVR bit 8. If HF3 is
;;		still not SET, then assert the hardware NMI and check HF3. 
;;		If it still does not SET, the DSP must be reset.
;;		
;;		Once HF3 has been set, DSP56001 registers and memory may be
;;		be written to or read from by following this procedure:
;;
;;		1: SET HF1 for writing to regs or memory.
;;		   CLEAR HF1 for reading, or if no data transmission occurs.
;;
;;		2: Read and save any data that might have been in RX.
;;
;;		3: Write the first instruction word to the host port (TX).
;;
;;		4: Write the second word or a NOP to the host port (TX).
;;
;;		5: If HF1 was SET, write the data word (to place in memory 
;;		   or a Reg) to the host port (TX).
;;
;;		   If HF1 was CLEAR, and you have uploaded an instr that will
;;		   write to the host port, wait for bit 0 in the ISR (RXDF) 
;;		   to be set. Then read and save the memory or register data.
;;
;;
;;RUN/TRACE execution:
;;
;;	DEGMON:	Host command initiated. Data value (if any) in HRX is not
;;		saved in HPD. HF3 is reset.
;;		The trace interrupt bit is set in the unstacked SR by the
;;		HOST for tracing.
;;		
;;	NeXT:	Set the CVR to $0 (RESET vector) | $80 = $80
;;		Read and save any data that might have been in RX.
;;		Wait for the CVR bit 8 to be cleared. 
;;		Now the RUN or TRACE is active.
;;		Wait for HF3 to be SET (allow time for DEGMON to reset it).
;;		This means that the SWI or TRACE has been reached.
;;		Note that "FREEZE" or NMI can be used to halt the program 
;;		if trace mode was not used and no breakpoint has been set.
;;
;;Note that the NeXT should read from RXL LAST and write to TXL LAST.
