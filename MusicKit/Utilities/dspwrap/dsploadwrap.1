.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I dsploadwrap
program is called by the 
.I dspwrap
program.  It is normally not run by itself.

.SH OPTIONS
Each option can be abbreviated to the shortest disambiguating extent.

.IP \fB\-relative\fR
Force treatment of input files as relative assembly.
This is automatic if the filename extension is '.lnk'
or '.dsp'.
.IP \fB\-absolute\fR
Force treatment of input files as absolute assembly.
This is automatic if the filename extension is '.lod'.
.IP \fB\-ug\fR
Force treatment of input files as unit generators.
The assembly type must be relative in this case.
Unit-generators require special structs to be output
into .m and .h files which are included by the
unit-generator's Objective-C class file. 
.IP \fB\-ap\fR
Force treatment of input files as array processing macros.
Array processor input files are handled like general purpose 
DSP programs.
.IP \fB\-system\fR
Load system code (and user code, if any). When this option is not 
present, only symbols and data for section USER are processed.
When set, the input file is completely loaded, including anything
from section SYSTEM it may have. Unless the -boot option is also 
present, the resulting file will be loaded into a running DSP,
allowing overwriting of system memory. This is a dangerous thing
to do, and it will only work if you know how to avoid clobbering
state info used while downloading into the DSP.  For example, 
overwriting system x variables (which contain various system
pointers and running status) could clobber the host interface.
.IP \fB\-simulator\fR
Generate a simulator host-interface file.
.IP \fB\-argtemplate\fR <\fIstring\fR>
Use <\fIstring\fR> as the argument template.
.IP \fB\-start\fR <\fIaddress\fR>
Sets the program start address to <\fIaddress\fR>, overriding
any address specified by the assembler END statement.
This option is only applicable to main programs, not unit
generators.
.IP \fB\-trace\fR
Sets the trace variable. To get all possible tracing, use -1.
