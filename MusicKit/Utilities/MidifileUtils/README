This directory contains two example programs to read and write data
between the MIDI driver and standard Level 0 midifile.  The Midifile
format is specified by the MIDI Manufacturer's Association, and is a
machine independant format allowing the interchange of MIDI (Musical
Instrument Digital Interface) sequence data.

The program playmidifile reads a standard Level 0 midifile and plays
it out through the MIDI driver.  This program illustrates both how to
parse a midifile and how to use the MIDI driver in a simple
application.  The playback may optionally be synchronized to incoming
MIDI time code.
 
The program recordmidifile read MIDI data from the MIDI driver and
writes directly to a file in the standard Level 0 midifile format.
This simple commandline utility records MIDI data until control-c is
typed, which then causes the collected data to be written to a file.
The times may be derived from the system clock or from incoming MIDI
time code.

For both utilities, the user must supply a file name argument, and can
give an argument to specify which serial port to accept data on.  They
can also specify a serial port to accept MIDI time code from.

There are a couple of test midifiles supplied to serve as simple
examples; they of course require a MIDI synthesizer to play them on.
See the MIDI driver documentation for further information about the
MIDI driver and about MIDI interfaces that works with it.

While these programs are functional and relatively clearly written,
they represent an API level altogether too low for typical use.
It is highly recommended the MusicKit Objective C framework API be
used for such tasks.
