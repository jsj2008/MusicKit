If you make a Music Kit program that you'd like us to consider for
distribution as part of the CCRMA Music Kit and DSP Tools Distribution, 
please send it to the following address:

	musickit@ccrma.stanford.edu.

If you do not have e-mail access, you can send floppies to 

	CCRMA
	The Knoll
	Attention: Music Kit
	Music Dept.
	Stanford University
	Stanford, CA. 94305

We are interested in applications, unit generators, synth patches, etc.

The file OtherNetSoftware is some mail outlining where other Music Kit and
DSP software can be found.
