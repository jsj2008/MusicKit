======================== FTP INFO ================================== 

1. To obtain the Music Kit and DSP Tools INSTALLATION PACKAGE:

>From a shell, type "ftp ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu".  Then login with the
name "anonymous" and your email address as a password.  Type "cd pub",
then "bin" to choose binary transfer mode.  Say "get
MusicKit_xxx.pkg.tar" to start the transfer, where "xxx" is the version
number you want (usually you want the latest one).  Once it is complete, say
"bye" to exit ftp, and unpack the file by typing "tar xvf
MusicKit_xxx.pgk.tar" followed by "open MusicKit_xxx.pkg" (or open the
package directly from the program /NextAdmin/Installer.app/Installer).

The Installer program will let you choose a directory in which to place the
installation tree.  If you are on a stand-alone machine, you should be
logged in (or running Installer) as root and choose "/" for the
installation directory (the default).  This will cause files to be placed
in the directories /LocalApps, /LocalLibrary, /LocalDeveloper, and
/usr/local.  If you are the system administrator for a network of NeXT
Computers, you probably want to choose a local directory which can be
exported and create symbolic links into that directory on the networked
machines.  Alternatively, if you have a single server that exports /Local*
and /usr/local, simply install the package there and you're done.

The size of the uninstalled package is about 10 mb.
The size of the installed package is about 24 mb.

2. ftp directions for obtaining SOURCE CODE:

As above, but the filename is instead "MusicKitSource_xxx.pkg.tar".  The
Installer program will let you choose a directory in which to place the
source tree, which can be anywhere.  Building this package creates the
installation package above.  Please read the README file to get started.  

The size of the uninstalled package is about 7 mb.
The size of the installed (but not built) package is about 21 mb.
