INSTALLATION

To install everything, cd to the top level directory (the one containing
this file) and say (as root)

	make install DSTROOT=/

This will make and install the release on your computer so you can use the
tools. Installation writes in the directories /usr/local, /LocalApps,
/LocalDeveloper, and /LocalLibrary.

After the installation is complete, have a look at the two files in
/LocalLibrary/Documentation/MusicKit+DSP/ReleaseNotes/ for further orientation.


DEFERRED INSTALLATION

By setting DSTROOT in the make command to a directory other than "/", you
can obtain a "root image" anywhere you want which can be copied into / at a
later time.  This is convenient when you want to install on multiple
machines, but build only once.  Look up the rdist program in the UNIX
Manual Pages for information on how to distribute the installation to
multiple machines.


SHARED INSTALLATION IN A NETWORK

Having been through a number of cases of this, we have a recommendation for
you: Dedicate One Server to hold all shared installations, and install into
"/" on that machine.  Export the directories /usr/local, /LocalApps,
/LocalDeveloper, and /LocalLibrary (and any others needed by other shared
packages) from that machine and have all the network client machines import
those directories from the One Server.  Give the server lots of disk space
and just pile everything onto it.  The problem you avoid this way is having
two different servers wanting to export files in /usr/local/bin,
/usr/local/lib, etc.  The alternative is lots of symbolic links which are
relatively cumbersome to manage.
