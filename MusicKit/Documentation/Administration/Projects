(This is obsolete, but has some important info)

When you say "make install DSTROOT=/root_dir" at the top level, all
projects are built.  It is also possible to say "make install DSTROOT=/foo"
(or any of the other make targets) within a particular project to build
only that project.

It is important to understand the distinction between source code
project and programming example projects.  When you build a source
code project, the source code is not installed; it is built ("made")
and the products of the build (libraries or executables) are
installed.  In contrast, when you build a programming example project,
the source itself is installed, but is not built.  If you want to
build the programming example itself, you can cd to the installed
source's directory and do a "make" there.  Of course, some directories
contain both programming examples and source code.  The Makefiles do
the appropriate thing.
