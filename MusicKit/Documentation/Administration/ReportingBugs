A "bug number" will be assigned by CCRMA when it is added to the bug list.

The bug report should be in the following format:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project: <Project name, e.g. musickit, synthpatches, dsp, ensemble, etc.>
Title: <one-line description of the problem>
Description: <complete description of the problem, including HOW TO REPRODUCE>
Progress: <any info toward finding and/or fixing the bug>
	Please list any known workaround for the bug.
	Please include a small programming example which reproduces the
	problem, if possible.

CCRMASoftwareVersion: <Which CCRMA release you are working with>
NeXTSoftwareVersion: <Which NeXT software release you are runnning>
NeXTHardwareVersion: <Your NeXT hardware configuration, briefly put>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can determine the CCRMA release version by looking at the file 
Doc/Administration/VERSION.  The NeXT release is given by the Workspace
Info panel.

There is no guarantee that your bug will be pursued by CCRMA staff or by
anyone else.  Since source code is provided, it is generally expected that
you can clear any problems that get in your way.  In special circumstances,
you might consider hiring a consultant to do what you want.
