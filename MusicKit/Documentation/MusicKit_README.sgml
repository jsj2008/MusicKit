  <para>
The MusicKit is an object-oriented software system for building
music, sound, signal processing, and MIDI applications.  It has been used
in such diverse commercial applications as music sequencers, computer
games, and document processors.  Professors and students in academia
have used the MusicKit in a host of areas, including music
performance, scientific experiments, computer-aided instruction, and
physical modeling.  The MusicKit was the first to unify the MIDI and
Music V paradigms, thus combining interaction with generality.  (Music
V, written by Max Mathews and others at Bell Labs three decades ago,
was the first widely available "computer music compiler".)
   </para>

   <para>
The NeXT MusicKit was first demonstrated at the 1988
NeXT product introduction and was bundled in NeXT software releases
1.0 and 2.0.  Beginning with NeXT's 3.0 release, the MusicKit was no
longer part of the standard NeXT software release.  Instead, it was
being distributed and supported by the Center for Computer  Research
in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) of Stanford University. Since 1999 and
version 5.0, the most recent releases have been generously supported by
my employer, 
<ulink url="http://www.tomandandy.com">tomandandy music inc.</ulink> 
as open source to the community.
   </para>

   <para>
     The <ulink url="http://www.tomandandy.com/MusicKit">
     MusicKit Distribution</ulink>
     is a comprehensive package that
     includes on-line documentation, programming examples, utilities,
     applications and sample score documents.
</para>

<para>
Source code is available for everything, with
the exception of the NeXT hardware implementation of the low-level
sound and DSP drivers.  This means researchers and developers may
study the source or even customize the Music Kit and DSP Tools to suit
their needs.  Enhancements can be sent to 
<email>leigh@tomandandy.com</email>
to have them incorporated for future releases. Commercial software
developers may freely incorporate and adapt the software to accelerate
development of software products.  (Free commercial use of files
copyrighted by NeXT Inc. are understandably restricted to NeXTSTEP
platforms.)

    <title>Supported Platforms</title>
    <para>
        The MusicKit currently runs on NeXT hardware and Intel-based hardware
        running OpenStep, Macintosh hardware running MacOsX Server and MacOsX
        (the latter currently without MIDI output), and Intel-based hardware
        running Windows 98 with Rhapsody DR2/NT or WebObjects/NT). Intel Linux
        support is achievable, planned, partially completed and looking for
        volunteers.
</para>
    <sect2 id="windows">
      <title>Windows support</title>
      <para>
After much fun with the pinnacle of Microsoft development tools, we
have the MusicKit working on Windows9X. The solution was to emulate
the Mach MIDI device driver with the core layer of DirectMusic. There
is a fairly similar match in functionality between these API with the
exception of the downloadable sound (DLS) capability of DirectMusic,
which provides a MIDI orientated sample playback API to PC
soundcards. While the future of Apple's
OpenStep/YellowBox/Cocoa/WebObjects (!) for Windows support is far
from clear, the combination of Gnu technologies of 
<ulink url="http://www.gnustep.org">GnuStep</ulink> and 
<ulink url="http://www.cygnus.com/cygwin">cygwin</ulink>
would suggest in the
near future that Apple's corporate interests will not dictate whether
applications can be deployed on either platform.

    <para>
David A. Jaffe <email>david@jaffe.com</email> and Julius O. Smith
III at NeXT did the original design, with David coding the Objective C
and Julius most of the 56K DSP. Their original design appeared in
<citation>JaffeBoynton89</citation>.
The Ensemble application and much of the SynthPatch
library were written by Michael Mcnabb.   Douglas Fulton had primary
responsibility  for the documentation. Dana Massie, James A. Moorer,
Lee Boynton, Greg Kellogg, Douglas Keislar, Michael Minnick, Perry
Cook, John Strawn, Rob Poor and Roger Dannenberg made code and design
contributions also. Following NeXT's release of the source to Stanford
in 1994, David did the port to Intel NeXTStep and the MPU-401 MIDI and
DSP drivers. There were some other bug fix contributors (acknowledged
in code comments).
</para> 

    <para>
Stephen Brandon <email>sbrandon@music.gla.ac.uk</email> did the initial
OpenStep port in early 1998 and the majority of the conversion
work. Leigh M. Smith <email>leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au</email>, now
<email>leigh@tomandandy.com</email> fixed bugs and ported the MusicKit
and MIDI drivers to Intel and PowerPC Rhapsody in late 1998 and
reorganised the packages and documentation for MacOsX Server. The port
from Rhapsody to MacOsX Server was trivial.  The frameworks were then
ported to Windows 98/NT using DirectMusic, with DirectSound interface
code contributed by SKoT McDonald <email>skot@tomandandy.com</email>. The
MusicKit now uses the SndKit, written by Stephen Brandon, rather than
the SoundKit for its sound processing. Keith Hamel tested and helped
in bug fixes for the MacOsX Server version.

In regard of this version as indicated at the top of this file
(consitituting all changes and modifications, porting efforts and
documentation), I am continuing this usage philosophy. The latest

  <sect1 id="works">
    <title>What works?</title>
    <para>
The frameworks have been exercised fairly extensively and seem quite
stable. MIDI recording and playback of scores and computed parts works
on all supported platforms. The examples
<application>MIDIFilePlayback</application> and
<command>playscorefilemidi</command> and the utility
<command>playscore</command> demonstrate these capabilities.

At the moment, there is no single make operation to build the entire
source tree. Compile either the MacOsX-Server or Windows
<filename>MKPerformSndMIDI</filename> framework, then either the
<filename>MKDSP_56k</filename> or <filename>MKDSP_Native</filename>
framework, then the <filename>MusicKit</filename> framework. They will
install into <filename
class=directory>/Local/Library/Frameworks</filename>. The
<filename>MKUnitGenerators</filename>/<filename>MKSynthPatches</filename>
framework won't compile on MacOsX-Server because the Motorola
<command>asm56000</command> and <command>lnk56000</command> tools are
missing. I've asked Apple and Motorola for a MacOsX-Server port, why
don't you also? :-) At the moment header files are problematic. I
copied over the 3.3 headers to compile against the SoundKit and to
compile the MIDI driver. These legacy headers may not actually be
needed and could be removed in time. You can get them from the Darwin
distribution of the SoundKit or just copy them from a NeXTStep
3.3/OpenStep 4.2 system.

DSP on MacOsX-Server. Stephen
mentioned he got sound out under OS4.2. However none of the dsp
drivers have been ported from NeXTStep V3.3 (as they are all ISA bus
cards and I don't know of a PCI 56K card with published interface
specs). A more fruitful avenue seems to be to convert the unit
generators to use Apples AltiVec vector libraries and then do an open
source version of them to support other vector processors. Another
option is to convert the unit generators to the MPEG Layer 4
structured audio language SAOL <citation>SAOL</citation>

(Need CMJ reference)

and modify the
MKDSP framework to download to a supporting card (or do the emulation
using the native processor).

Documentation is currently in Rich Text Format (RTF). Beginning with

For this current revision the .nibs have been

to obtain a set
that work with OpenStep 4.2. Future versions of the MusicKit will have
both nib sets for backward compatibility with OpenStep 4.2. Eventually
Apple's InterfaceBuilder will produce XML based nibs which should
