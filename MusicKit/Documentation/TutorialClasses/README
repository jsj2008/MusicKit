This directory contains teaching materials for the CCRMA Music Kit
class taught by David A. Jaffe in Jan-Feb 1991.  This is an intensive
class for programmers who already know the C Programming Language and
are somewhat familiar with the NeXT Computer.  The materials on this
directory may be distributed and used for teaching purposes.  However,
any publication is forbidden without the written consent of David A.
Jaffe (reachable as daj@ccrma.stanford.edu).

The students should have a copy of the Concepts section of the NeXT
Technical Documentation, particularly the volume entitled
"Sound/Music/DSP."  The students should be running 2.1 software and
should refer to the on-line documentation for the Reference section of
the NeXT Technical Documentation.  The on-line 2.1 version is more up
to date than any of the published hard copy versions at the time of
this writing (Feb. 13, 1992.)
