\b0 \cf0 \
Version 5 of the MusicKit mostly consists of conversion to the OpenStep specification from the older NeXTStep API.\
\
Libraries have now been replaced as frameworks:\
\
MusicKit.framework\
MKDSP.framework\
MKPerformSndMIDI.framework\
MKSynthPatches.framework\
MKUnitGenerators.framework\
\
The root hierarchical include file is now #imported as <MusicKit/MusicKit.h> replacing\
<musickit/musickit.h>\
\
Unitgenerators headers are included from unitgenerators framework, not musickit/unitgenerators.\
\
All the public MusicKit classes are now prefixed with MK to match the Foundation/AppKit model, ie MKNote, MKOrchestra. In a similar manner to the changes in other Frameworks when OpenStep-ified, as well as name changes, there are object allocation changes.\

\b \cf0 MKMidi
\b0 \
+new has been renamed +midi in keeping with OpenStep conventions.\
allocFromZone:onDevice: and allocFromZone:onDevice:hostName have been replaced with corresponding \
-initOnDevice: and -initOnDevice:hostName: instance methods and +midiOnDevice: +midiOnDevice:hostName: class methods to support OpenStep allocation conventions.\
\
-(NSString *)driverName replaces (char *) driverName\
\
** noteSenders and noteReceivers doesn't return a copy of the array. The parent object is expected to copy it. Perhaps it shouldn't??\
\

\b MKNote
\b0 \
+new is now +note\
\

\b MKScore
\b0 \
+new is now +score returning an autoreleased instance.}
