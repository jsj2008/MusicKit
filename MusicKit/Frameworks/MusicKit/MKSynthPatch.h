  Description:
    A MKSynthPatch contains an NSArray of unit generators which behave as
    a functional unit.
    
    MKSynthPatches are not created by the application. Rather, they
    are created by the MKOrchestra. The MKOrchestra is also
    responsible for filling the MKSynthPatch instance with MKUnitGenerator and
    MKSynthData instances. It does this on the basis of a template provided by the
    MKSynthPatch class method +patchTemplate. The subclass designer implements
    this method to provide a MKPatchTemplate which specifies what the mix of
    MKUnitGenerators and MKSynthData objects should
    be, in what order it should be allocated, and how to connect them up.
    (See MKPatchTemplate.)
    The MKSynthPatch instance, thus, is an NSArray containing the MKUnitGenerators
    and MKSynthData objects in the order they were specified in the template and
    connected as specified in the template.

    MKSynthPatches can be in one of three states:
    MK_running
    MK_finishing
    MK_idle

    The subclass may supply methods to be invoked at the initialiation
    (creation), noteOn, noteOff, noteUpdate and end-of-note (noteEnd) times, as
    described below.

    MKSynthPatches are ordinarily used in conjunction with a Conducted
    performance by using a MKSynthInstrument. The MKSynthInstrument manages the allocation
    of MKSynthPatches in response to incoming MKNotes. Alternatively, MKSynthPatches
    may be used in a stand-alone fashion. In this case, you must allocate the
    MKSynthPatch by sending the MKOrchestra the -allocSynthPatch: or
    allocSynthPatch:patchTemplate: method.

     The return value is a duration to wait before releasing the
