  Defined In: The MusicKit

  Description:
    During a MusicKit performance, MKInstrument objects realize MKNotes that
    are sent to them from MKPerformer objects.  The MKNoteReceiver class
    defines the MKNote-receiving mechanism used by MKInstruments; each
    MKNoteReceiver object acts as a MKNote input for an MKInstrument.  Closely
    related to MKNoteReceiver is the MKNoteSender class, which defines the
    MKNote-sending mechanism used by MKPerformers.  By separating these
    mechanisms into distinct classes, any MKInstrument can have multiple
    inputs and any MKPerformer, multiple outputs.
   
    A MKNoteReceiver is added to an MKInstrument through the latter's
    addNoteReceiver: method.  While an application can create MKNoteReceivers
    and add them to an MKInstrument, this is typically done by the MKInstrument itself
    when it's created.  You can retrieve the object to which a MKNoteReceiver has
    been added by invoking MKNoteReceiver's owner method.
   
    To send MKNotes from a MKNoteSender to a MKNoteReceiver, the two objects must be
    connected.  This is done through the connect: method:
   
    	[aNoteReceiver connect:aNoteSender]
   
    Every MKNoteReceiver and MKNoteSender contains a list of connections.  The
    connect: method adds either object to the other's list; in other
    words, the MKNoteReceiver is added to the MKNoteSender's list and the
    MKNoteSender is added to the MKNoteReceiver's list.  Both MKNoteReceiver and
    MKNoteSender implement connect: as well as disconnect: and disconnect,
    methods used to sever connections.  A MKNoteReceiver can be connected to
    any number of MKNoteSenders.  Connections can be established and severed
    during a performance.
   
    The MKNote-receiving mechanism is defined in the receiveNote: method.
    When a MKNoteReceiver receives the message receiveNote: it sends the
    message realizeNote:fromNoteReceiver: to its owner, with the received
    MKNote as the first argument and its own id as the second.  receiveNote:
    is automatically invoked when a connected MKNoteSender sends a Note.
    You can toggle a MKNoteReceiver's MKNote-forwarding capability through the
    squelch and unsquelch methods; a MKNoteReceiver ignores the MKNotes it
    receives while it's squelched.  A newly created MKNoteReceiver is
    unsquelched.
