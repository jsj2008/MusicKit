@interface MKNoteReceiver: NSObject
/* 
 * During a Music Kit performance, Instrument objects realize Notes that
 * are sent to them from Performer objects.  The NoteReceiver class
 * defines the Note-receiving mechanism used by Instruments; each
 * NoteReceiver object acts as a Note input for an Instrument.  Closely
 * related to NoteReceiver is the MKNoteSender class, which defines the
 * Note-sending mechanism used by Performers.  By separating these
 * mechanisms into distinct classes, any Instrument can have multiple
 * inputs and any Performer, multiple outputs.
 * 
 * A NoteReceiver is added to an Instrument through the latter's
 * addNoteReceiver: method.  While an application can create NoteReceivers
 * and add them to an Instrument, this is typically done by the Instrument itself
 * when it's created.  You can retrieve the object to which a NoteReceiver has
 * been added by invoking NoteReceiver's owner method.
 * 
 * To send Notes from a MKNoteSender to a NoteReceiver, the two objects must be
 * connected.  This is done through the connect: method:
 *
 * 	[aNoteReceiver connect:aNoteSender]
 *
 * Every NoteReceiver and MKNoteSender contains a list of connections.  The
 * connect: method adds either object to the other's list; in other
 * words, the NoteReceiver is added to the MKNoteSender's list and the
 * MKNoteSender is added to the NoteReceiver's list.  Both NoteReceiver and
 * MKNoteSender implement connect: as well as disconnect: and disconnect,
 * methods used to sever connections.  A NoteReceiver can be connected to
 * any number of NoteSenders.  Connections can be established and severed
 * during a performance.
 *
 * The Note-receiving mechanism is defined in the receiveNote: method.
 * When a NoteReceiver receives the message receiveNote: it sends the
 * message realizeNote:fromNoteReceiver: to its owner, with the received
 * Note as the first argument and its own id as the second.  receiveNote:
 * is automatically invoked when a connected MKNoteSender sends a Note.
 * You can toggle a NoteReceiver's Note-forwarding capability through the
 * squelch and unsquelch methods; a NoteReceiver ignores the Notes it
 * receives while it's squelched.  A newly created NoteReceiver is
 * unsquelched.
 *
