  Description:
    A MKPatchTemplate is a recipe for building a MKSynthPatch object.  It
    contains specifications for the MKUnitGenerator and MKSynthData objects
    that are needed and instructions for connecting these objects
    together.

    MKPatchTemplate's addUnitGenerator:ordered: and addSynthData:length:
    methods describe the objects that make up the MKSynthPatch.  It's
    important to keep in mind that these methods don't add actual objects
    to the MKPatchTemplate.  Instead, they specify the types of objects that
    will be created when the MKSynthPatch is constructed by the MKOrchestra.

    A MKPatchTemplate's MKUnitGenerators are specified by their class, given
    as the first argument to the addUnitGenerator:ordered: method.  The
    argument should be a MKUnitGenerator leaf class, not a master class
    (leaf and master classes are explained in the MKUnitGenerator class
    description).

    The MKUnitGenerator is further described as being ordered or unordered,
    as the argument to the ordered: keyword is YES or NO.  Ordered
    MKUnitGenerators are executed (on the DSP) in the order that they're
    added to the MKPatchTemplate; unordered MKUnitGenerators are executed in
    an undetermined order.  Usually, the order in which MKUnitGenerators are
    executed is significant; for example, if the output of MKUnitGenerator A
    is read by MKUnitGenerator B, then A must be executed before B if no
    delay is to be incurred.  As a convenience, the addUnitGenerator:
    method is provided to add MKUnitGenerators that are automatically
    declared as ordered.  The advantage of unordered MKUnitGenerators is
    that their allocation is less constrained.
  
    MKSynthDatas are specified by a DSP memory segment and a length.  The
    memory segment is given as the first argument to addSynthData:length:.
    This can be either MK_xData, for x data memory, or MK_yData, for y
    data memory.  Which memory segment to specify depends on where the
    MKUnitGenerators that access it expects it to be.  The argument to the
    length: keyword specifies the size of the SynthData, or how much DSP
    memory it represents, and is given as DSPDatum (24-bit) words.
  
    A typical use of a MKSynthData is to create a location called a
    patchpoint that's written to by one MKUnitGenerator and then read by
    another.  A patchpoint, which is always 8 words long, is ordinarily
    the only way that two MKUnitGenerators can communicate.  The
    addPatchPoint: method is provided as a convenient way to add
    MKSynthDatas that are used as patchpoints.  The argument to this method
    is either MK_xPatch or MK_yPatch, for x and y patchpoint memory,
    respectively.
  
    The four object-adding methods return a unique integer that identifies
    the added MKUnitGenerator or MKSynthData.
  
    Once you have added the requisite synthesis elements to a
    PatchTemplate, you can specify how they are connected.  This is done
    through invocations of the to:sel:arg: method.  The first argument is
    an integer that identifies a MKUnitGenerator (such as returned by
    addUnitGenerator:), the last argument is an integer that identifies a
    MKSynthData (or patchpoint).  The argument to the sel: keyword is a
    selector that's implemented by the MKUnitGenerator and that takes a
    MKSynthData object as its only argument.  Typical selectors are
    setInput: (the MKUnitGenerator reads from the MKSynthData) and setOuput:
    (it writes to the MKSynthData).  Notice that you can't connect a
    MKUnitGenerator directly to another MKUnitGenerator.
