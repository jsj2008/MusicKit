/* 
 * 
 * Performer is an abstract class that defines the general mechanism for
 * performing Notes during a Music Kit performance.  Each subclass of
 * Performer implements the perform method to define how it obtains and
 * performs Notes.
 * 
 * During a performance, a Performer receives a series of perform
 * messages.  In its implementation of perform, a Performer subclass must
 * set the nextPerform variable.  nextPerform indicates the amount of
 * time (in beats) to wait before the next perform message arrives.  The
 * messages are sent by the Performer's Conductor.  Every Performer is
 * managed by a Conductor; unless you set its Conductor explicitly,
 * through the setConductor: method, a Performer is managed by the the
 * defaultConductor.
 * 
 * A Performer contains a List of NoteSenders, objects that send Notes
 * (to NoteReceivers) during a performance.  Performer subclasses should
 * implement the init method to create and add some number of
 * NoteSenders to a newly created instance.  As part of its perform
 * method, a Performer typically creates or othewise obtains a Note (for
 * example, by reading it from a Part or a scorefile) and sends it by
 * invoking MKNoteSender's sendNote: method.
 * 
 * To use a Performer in a performance, you must first send it the
 * activate message.  activate invokes the activateSelf method and then
 * schedules the first perform message request with the Conductor.
 * activateSelf can be overridden in a subclass to provide further
 * initialization of the Performer.  The performance begins when the
 * Conductor class receives the startPerformance message.  It's legal to
 * activate a Performer after the performance has started.
 * 
 * Sending the deactivate message removes the Performer from the
 * performance and invokes the deactivate method.  This method can be
 * overridden to implement any necessary finalization, such as freeing
 * contained objects.
 * 
 * During a performance, a Performer can be stopped and restarted by
 * sending it the pause and resume messages, respectively.  perform
 * messages destined for a paused Performer are delayed until the object
 * is resumed.
 * 
 * You can shift a Performer's performance timing by setting its
 * timeShift variable.  timeShift, measured in beats, is added to the
 * initial setting of nextPerform.  If the value of timeShift is
 * negative, the Performer's Notes are sent earlier than otherwise
 * expected; this is particularly useful for a Performer that's
 * performing Notes starting from the middle of a Part or Score.  A
 * positive timeShift delays the performance of a Note.
 * 
 * You can also set a Performer's maximum duration.  A Performer is
 * automatically deactivated if its performance extends beyond duration
 * beats.
 * 
 * A Performer has a status, represented as one of the following
 * MKPerformerStatus values:
 *  
 * 
 * * Status       Meaning
 * * MK_inactive  A deactivated or not-yet-activated Performer.
 * * MK_active    An activated, unpaused Performer.
 * * MK_paused    The Performer is activated but currently paused.
 * 
 * Some messages can only be sent to an inactive (MK_inactive) Performer.
 * A Performer's status can be queried with the status message.
 * 
 * CF: Conductor, MKNoteSender
