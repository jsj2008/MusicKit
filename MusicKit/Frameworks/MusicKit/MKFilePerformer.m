@implementation MKFilePerformer: MKPerformer
/* A FilePerformer reads data from a file on the disk,
 * fashions a Note object from the data, and then performs
 * the Note.  An abstract superclass, FilePerformer
 * provides common functionality and declares subclass responsibilities
 * for the subclasses
 * MidifilePerformer and ScorefilePerformer.
 *
 * Note: In release 1.0, MidifilePerformer is not provided. Use a Score object
 * to read a Midifile.
 *
 * A FilePerformer is associated with a file, either by the
 * file's name or with a file pointer.  If you assoicate
 * a FilePerformer with a file name (through the \fBsetFile:\fR
 * method) the object will take care of opening and closing
 * the file for you:  the file is opened for reading when the
 * FilePerformer receives the \fBactivate\fR message and closed when
 * it receives \fBdeactivate\fR.  
 *
 * The \fBsetStream:\fR method associates a FilePerformer with a file
 * pointer.  In this case, opening and closing the file
 * is the responsibility of the application.  The FilePerformer's
 * file pointer is set to \fBNULL\fR after each performance 
 * so you must send another
 * \fBsetStream:\fR message in order to replay the file.
 *
 * Note:  The argument to \fBsetStream:\fR
 * is typically a pointer to a file on the disk, but it can also
 * be a UNIX socket or pipe.
 *
 * The FilePerformer class declares two methods as subclass responsibilities:
 * \fBnextNote\fR and \fBperformNote:\fR.
 * \fBnextNote\fR must be subclassed to access the next line of information
 * from the file and from it create either a Note object or a 
 * time value.  It 
 * returns the Note that it creates, or, in the case of a time value,
 * it sets the instance variable \fBfileTime\fR to represent
 * the current time in the file 
 * and returns \fBnil\fR.
 * 
 * The Note created by \fBnextNote\fR is passed as the argument
 * to \fBperformNote:\fR which 
 * is responsible
 * for performing any manipulations on the
 * Note and then sending it
 * by invoking \fBsendNote:\fR.  The return value of \fBperformNote:\fR
 * is disregarded.  
 *
 * Both \fBnextNote\fR and \fBperformNote:\fR are invoked 
 * by the \fBperform\fR method, which, recall from the Performer
 * class, is itself never called directly but is sent by a Conductor.
 * \fBperform\fR also checks and incorporates the time limit
 * and performance offset established by the timing window
 * variables inherited from Performer; \fBnextNote\fR and 
 * \fBperformNote:\fR needn't access nor otherwise be concerned
 * about these variables.
 *
 * Two other methods, \fBinitFile\fR and \fBfinishFile\fR, can
 * be redefined by a FilePerformer subclass, although neither
 * must be.  \fBinitializeFile\fR is invoked 
 * when the object is activated and should perform any special
 * initialization such as reading the file's header or magic number.
 * If \fBinitializeFile\fR returns \fBnil\fR, the FilePerformer is deactivated.
 * The default returns the receiver.
 *
 * \fBfinishFile\fR is invoked when the FilePerformer is deactivated
 * and should perform any post-performance cleanup.  Its return
 * value is disregarded.
 * 
 * A FilePerformer reads and performs one Note at a time.  This
 * allows efficient performance of arbitrarily large files.
 * Compare this to the 
 * Score object which reads and processes the entire file
 * before performing the first note.  However, unlike the Score object,
 * the FilePerformer doesn't allow individual timing control over the 
 * different Note streams in the file; the timing window
 * specifications inherited from Performer are applied to the entire
 * file.
 *
 * Any number of FilePerformers can perform the 
 * same file concurrently.
