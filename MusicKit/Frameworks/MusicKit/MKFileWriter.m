  Description:
    A MKFileWriter is an MKInstrument that realizes MKNotes by writing them to
    a file on the disk. An abstract superclass, MKFileWriter
    provides common functionality and declares subclass responsibilities
    for the subclasses MKMidifileWriter and MKScorefileWriter.
    Note: In this release, MKMidifileWriter is not provided. Use a MKScore object
    to write a Midifile.
   
    A MKFileWriter is associated with a file, either by the
    file's name or with a file pointer.  If you assoicate
    a MKFileWriter with a file name (through the setFile:
    method) the object will take care of opening and closing
    the file for you:  the file is opened for writing when the
    object first receives the realizeNote: message
    and closed after the performance.  The
    file is overwritten each time it's opened.
   
    The setStream: method associates a MKFileWriter with a file
    pointer.  In this case, opening and closing the file
    is the responsibility of the application.  The MKFileWriter's
    file pointer is set to NULL after each performance.
   
    To design a subclass of MKFileWriter you must implement
    the method realizeNote:fromNoteReceiver:.
   
    Two other methods, initializeFile and finishFile, can
    be redefined in a subclass, although neither
    must be.  initializeFile is invoked
    just before the first Note is written to the
    file and should perform any special
    initialization such as writing a file header.
   
    finishFile is invoked after each performance
    and should perform any post-performance cleanup.
    The values returned by initializeFile and finishFile are ignored.
