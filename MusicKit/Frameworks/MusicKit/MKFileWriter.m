                 support.
  03/21/90/daj - Added archiving.
  04/21/90/daj - Small mods to get rid of -W compiler warnings.
  08/23/90/daj - Changed to zone API.

@implementation MKFileWriter:MKInstrument
/* A FileWriter is an Instrument that realizes Notes
 * by writing them to a file on the disk.
 * An abstract superclass, FileWriter
 * provides common functionality and declares subclass responsibilities
 * for the subclasses
 * MidifileWriter and ScorefileWriter.
 * Note: In release 1.0, MidifileWriter is not provided. Use a Score object
 * to write a Midifile.
 * 
 * A FileWriter is associated with a file, either by the
 * file's name or with a file pointer.  If you assoicate
 * a FileWriter with a file name (through the \fBsetFile:\fR
 * method) the object will take care of opening and closing
 * the file for you:  the file is opened for writing when the
 * object first receives the \fBrealizeNote:\fR message
 * and closed after the performance.  The 
 * file is overwritten each time it's opened.
 *
 * The \fBsetStream:\fR method associates a FileWriter with a file
 * pointer.  In this case, opening and closing the file
 * is the responsibility of the application.  The FileWriter's
 * file pointer is set to \fBNULL\fR after each performance.
 *
 * To design a subclass of FileWriter you must implement
 * the method \fBrealizeNote:fromNoteReceiver:\fR.
 *
 * Two other methods, \fBinitializeFile\fR and \fBfinishFile\fR, can
 * be redefined in a subclass, although neither
 * must be.  \fBinitializeFile\fR is invoked 
 * just before the first Note is written to the 
 * file and should perform any special
 * initialization such as writing a file header.
 *
 * \fBfinishFile\fR is invoked after each performance
 * and should perform any post-performance cleanup.  The values returned
 * by \fBinitializeFile\fR and \fBfinishFile\fR are ignored.
