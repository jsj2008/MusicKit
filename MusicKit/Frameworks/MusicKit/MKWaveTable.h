 * 
 * A WaveTable contain an array of data that's used by a UnitGenerator
 * object as a lookup table.  The Music Kit provides two subclasses of
 * this absract class: Partials, and Samples.
 * 
 * Access to the data is through one of the data: methods.  The method
 * used depends on the data type needed (type DSPDatum (i.e., for the
 * DSP) or type double), the scaling needed and the length of the array
 * needed.  If necessary, the subclass is called upon to recompute the
 * data.  These methods do not copy the data. Thus, the caller should not
 * free or alter the array of data. The need to recompute is recognized
 * on the basis of whether the length or scaling instance variables have
 * changed.  The subclass can signal that a recomputation is needed by
 * setting length to 0.
 *     
 * The computation of the data is handled by the subclass method
 * fillTableLength:scale:.
