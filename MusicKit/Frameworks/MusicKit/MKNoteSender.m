/* MKNoteSender provides a mechanism for broadcasting
 * Note objects during a Music Kit performance.
 *
 * [aNoteSender connect:aNoteReceiver]
 *
 * A connection can be any object that implements
 * the method receiveNote:.
 * In a typical Music Kit performance, the connection set consists
 * exclusively of NoteReceivers which are owned by NoteFilters and Instruments.
 *
 * MKNoteSender's sendNote: method defines the Note-sending
 * mechanism:  when a MKNoteSender receives the message sendNote:aNote,
 * it forwards the argument (a Note object)
 * by sending the message receiveNote:aNote
 * to each of its connections.  
 * Similarly, an arbitrary message with two optional arguments
 * can be sent to the connections through one of the elementsPerform:
 * methods.
 *
 * Performers usually send sendNote: to self as part of their
 * perform: method and NoteFilter sends the message 
 * from its receiveNote: method.
 *
 * You can squelch a MKNoteSender by sending it the squelch message.
 * A squelched MKNoteSender suppresses 
 * messages that it would otherwise send to its connections.
