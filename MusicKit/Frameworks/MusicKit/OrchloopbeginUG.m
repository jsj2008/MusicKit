  Description:
    This is a minimal implementation of OrchloopbeginUG.m, a subclass of UnitGenerator.
    It was auto-generated by dspwrap from DSP source code.
    This file and OrchloopbeginUG.h should be extended and rewritten to provide a
    higher level, device-independent interface to the SynthPatch programmer.
    See MKUnitGenerator.h and the UnitGenerator spec
    for more information regarding unit-generator method design.
