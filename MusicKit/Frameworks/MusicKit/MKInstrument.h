 Description: 
   MKInstrument is an abstract class that defines the general mechanism for
   obtaining and realizing MKNotes during a MusicKit performance.  Each
   subclass of MKInstrument defines its particular manner of realization by
   implementing realizeNote:fromNoteReceiver:.
  
   Every MKInstrument contains a NSMutableArray of MKNoteReceivers, objects
   that receive MKNotes during a performance.  Each subclass of MKInstrument
   should implement its init method to automatically create and add
   some number of MKNoteReceivers to a newly created instance.  When a
   MKNoteReceiver receives a MKNote (through the receiveNote: method), it
   causes realizeNote:fromNoteReceiver: to be sent to its MKInstrument with
   the MKNote as the first argument and the MKNoteReceiver's id as the second
   argument.
  
   An MKInstrument is considered to be in performance from the time it
   realizes its first MKNote until the peformance is over.
  
   The MKInstrument subclasses provided by the MusicKit are:
  
   Subclass             Realization
   --------             -----------
   MKNoteFilter         Processes the MKNote and sends it on.
   MKNoteRecorder       Adds the MKNote to a MKPart or writes it to a file.
   MKSynthInstrument    Synthesizes a musical sound on the DSP.
