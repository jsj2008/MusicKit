@interface MKScorePerformer : NSObject
/* 
 * 
 * A ScorePerformer performs a Score object by creating a group of
 * PartPerformers, one for each Part in the Score, and controlling the
 * group's performance.  ScorePerformer itself isn't a Performer but it
 * does define a number of methods, such as activate, pause, and resume,
 * that resemble Performer methods.  When a ScorePerformer receives such
 * a message, it simply forwards it to each of its PartPerformer objects,
 * which are true Performers.
 * 
 * ScorePerformer also has a Performer-like status; it can be active,
 * inactive, or paused.  The status of a ScorePerformer is, in general,
 * the same as the status of all of its PartPerformers.  For instance,
 * when you send the activate message to a ScorePerformer, its status
 * becomes MK_active as does the status of all its PartPerformers.
 * However, you can access and control a PartPerformer independent of the
 * ScorePerformer that created it.  Thus, an individual PartPerformer's
 * status can be different from that of the ScorePerformer.
 * 
 * A ScorePerformer's score is set and its PartPerformers are created
 * when it receives the setScore: message.  If you add Parts to or remove
 * Parts from the Score after sending the setScore: message, the changes
 * will not be seen by the ScorePerformer.
