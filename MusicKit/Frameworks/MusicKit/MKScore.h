  Description:
    A MKScore is a collection of MKPart objects.  MKScores can be read from and
    written to a scorefile or midifile, performed with a MKScorePerformer,
    and an be used to record MKNotes from a MKScoreRecorder.

    Each MKScore has an info MKNote (a mute) that defines, in its parameters,
    information that can be useful in performing or otherwise interpreting
    the MKScore.  Typical information includes tempo, DSP headroom (see the
    MKOrchestra class), and sampling rate (the parameters MK_tempo,
    MK_headroom, and MK_samplingRate are provided to accommodate this
    utility).

    When you read a scorefile into a MKScore, a MKPart object is created and
    added to the MKScore for each MKPart name in the file's part statement.
    If the MKScore already contains a MKPart with the same name as a MKPart in
    the file, the MKNotes from the two sources are merged together in the
    existing MKPart in the MKScore.

    MKScoreFile print statements are printed as the scorefile is read into a
    MKScore. You can set the stream on which the messages are printed by
    invoking setScorefilePrintStream:.
