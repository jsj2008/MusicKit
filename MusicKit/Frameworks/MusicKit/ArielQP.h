/* This class is the Orchestra that represents the Quint Processor "hub"
 * (or "master") DSP.  Creating an instance of ArielQP also creates the
 * associated "satellite" DSPs ("sat" for short).  These are also called
 * "slave" DSPs.  Note, however, that sending -open (or -run, etc.) to the ArielQP
 * opens (or whatever) only the hub orchestra.   To send a messge to all the 
 * satellite DSPs for this QuintProcessor, invoke the method makeSatellitesPerform:.
 * Example:  [anArielQP makeSatellitesPerform:@selector(open)];  To send to all
 * the DSPs for the QP, invoked makeQPPerform:.
 *
 * You may control whether sound from the satellite DSPs is brought into the
 * hub DSP.  To control whether such sound is included or excluded, send 
 * setSatSoundIn:.  The defualt is to include it.  Excluding it
 * saves processing power on the hub, but means that the satellites will be useless,
 * unless they send their sound out their serial port.
 *
 * If the satellite sound is included, it can be accessed via the In1qpUG UnitGenerator.
 * Each instance of this unit generator takes sound from a particular channel on
 * a particular DSP.  Note that you may have any number of these so that you can
 * have multiple effects applied to the sound coming from a single source.
 *
 * For the common case of simply mixing each satellite to the output sample stream,
 * a SynthPatch called ArielQPMix is provided in the Music Kit SynthPatch Library.
 * This SynthPatch needs only to be allocated to work.   Be sure to deallocate it 
 * before closing the Orchestra.
