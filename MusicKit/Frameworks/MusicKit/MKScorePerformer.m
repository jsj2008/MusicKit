  Description: 
    A pseudo-performer that does its work by managing a set of MKPartPerformers.
    Many of the methods resemble MKPerformer methods, but they operate by
    doing a broadcast to the contained MKPartPerformers.

    Note that while MKScorePerformer resembles a MKPerformer, it is not identical
    to a MKPerformer and some care must be taken when using it. For example,
    the method -noteSenders returns the MKNoteSenders of the MKPartPerformers.
    The MKScorePerformer itself does not have any MKNoteSenders. Thus, to find
    the name of one of these, you have to specify the owner as the
    MKPartPerformer, not as the MKScorePerformer. If you use the MKNoteSender
    owner method to determine the owner, you won't have any problem.

/* Modification history:

   $Log$
   Revision 1.3  1999/09/04 22:42:22  leigh
   extra doco from implementation ivar descriptions

   Revision 1.2  1999/07/29 01:16:42  leigh
   Added Win32 compatibility, CVS logs, SBs changes

   03/17/90/daj - Added delegate mechanism. Added settable PartPerformerClass
   04/21/90/daj - Small mods to get rid of -W compiler warnings.
   08/27/90/daj - Changes to support zone API
   02/07/91/daj - Fixed bug that could cause ScorePerformer's delegate message
   		  to be sent twice.  Also added support for invoking 
		  ScorePerformer's deactivate when all its PartPerformers
		  are automatically deactivated.  It could be argued that,
		  for consistancy, we should make it so that ScorePerformer's 
		  activate method is invoked if individual PartPerformers are 
		  activated and the same for pause/resume. But it could also
		  be argued that the "score-as-a-whole" should not be
		  considered active unless it was explicitly activated. 
		  The same cannot be said of deactivating -- if all 
		  PartPerformers have reached the end of their data and
		  have deactivated themselves, it's hard to argue for anything 
		  but the interpretation that the "score-as-a-whole" should
		  automatically be deactivated. So that's what happens now.
		  This is less than clean, but probably nobody will ever
		  notice (!).
   06/06/92/daj - Changed freePartPerformers to refuse to do so if the
                  ScorePerformer is in performance.
   11/01/94/daj - Fixed _partPerformerDidDeactivate: so it correctly notices
	          when all PartPerformers are deactivated.
