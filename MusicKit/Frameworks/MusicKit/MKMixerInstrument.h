  Description:
    MKMixerInstrument mixes soundfiles based on a score description of the mix. 
    It allows setting the amplitude scaling of each soundfile and to
    change that scaling over time by applying an amplitude envelope. It
    allows resampling (change the pitch of) a file.  It also allows
    you to specify that only a portion of a file be used in the mix.
    There is no limit to the number of soundfiles that may be mixed
    together. Also, the same soundfile may be mixed several times and may
    overlap with itself.  The soundfiles may have different sampling rates
    and different formats.  However, the output must be 16 bit linear.
    The mix is done on the main CPU, rather than the DSP.  The more files
    you mix, the longer it will take the program to run.  Note also that
    if you mix many large files, you will need a fair degree of swap
    space--keep some room free on the disk off of which you booted.

    MKMixerInstrument is also an illustration of how to make your own MusicKit
    MKInstrument subclass to "realize Notes" in some novel fashion. In this
    case, MKNotes are soundfile mix specifications. They are "realized" by
    being mixed into the output file.

  Original Author: David A. Jaffe, with Michael McNabb adding the
    enveloping and pitch transposition, the latter based on code
    provided by Julius Smith. Incorporation into the MusicKit framework, conversion
    to OpenStep and the SndKit by Leigh M. Smith.
