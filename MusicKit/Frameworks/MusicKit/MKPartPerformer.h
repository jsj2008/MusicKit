@interface MKPartPerformer : MKPerformer
/* 
 * 
 * A PartPerformer object performs the Notes in a particular Part.  Every
 * PartPerformer has exactly one MKNoteSender.  A PartPerformer is
 * associated with a Part through its setPart: method.  While a single
 * PartPerformer can only be associated with one Part, any number of
 * PartPerformers can by associated with the same Part.  If you're
 * performing a Score, you can use ScorePerformer to create
 * PartPerformers for you (one for each Part in the Score).
 * 
 * When you activate a PartPerformer (through activateSelf) the object
 * copies its Part's List of Notes (it doesn't copy the Notes
 * themselves).  When it's performed, the PartPerformer sequences over
 * its copy of the List, allowing you to edit the Part (by adding or
 * removing Notes) without disturbing the performance -- changes made to
 * a Part during a performance are not seen by the PartPerformer.
 * However, since only the List of Notes is copied but not the Notes
 * themselves, you should neither alter nor free a Part's Notes during a
 * performance.
 * 
 * The timing variables firstTimeTag, lastTimeTag, beginTime,
 * and duration affect the timing and performance duration of a
 * PartPerformer.  Only the Notes with timeTag values between
 * firstTimeTag and lastTimeTag (inclusive) are performed.  Each of these 
 * notes performance times is computed as its timeTag plus timeShift.
 * If the newly computed performance time is greater than duration, the Note 
 * is suppressed and the PartPerformer is deactivated.
 * 
 * CF: ScorePerformer, Part
