  SnoiseUG - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/snoise.asm (see source for details).

  You instantiate a subclass of the form SnoiseUG<a>, where 
  <a> = space of output.

  SnoiseUG computes uniform pseudo-white noise using the linear congruential 
  method for random number generation (reference: Knuth, volume II of The Art 
  of Computer Programming).   Whereas UnoiseUG computes a new random value
  every sample, SnoiseUG computes a new random value every tick (16 samples),
  and is 3 times faster.
