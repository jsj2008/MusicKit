/* DswitchtUG  - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/dswitcht.asm (see source for details).

  The DswitchUG switches from input1 (scaled by scale1) to a 
  input2 (scaled by scale2) after a delay specified in samples.  The delay
  can be interpreted as the number of samples input1 is passed to 
  the output.  On each output sample, the delay is decremented by 1.
  Input1 times the scale factor scale1 is passed to the output as long 
  as delay remains nonnegative. Afterwards, input2 is passed 
  to the output with its own scaling.

  You instantiate a subclass of the form 
  DswitchtUG<a><b>, where 
	<a> = space of output	
	<b> = space of inputs
