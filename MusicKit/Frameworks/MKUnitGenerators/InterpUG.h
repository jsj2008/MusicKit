/* InterpUG  - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/interp.asm (see source for details).

   Outputs an interpolation of two input signals, with the blend controlled 
   by a third signal, i.e.,   

       out = input1 + (input2-input1) * control
   
   You allocate one of the subclasses InterpUG<a><b><c><d>, where <a> is the output 
   space, <b> and <c> are the input signal spaces, and <d> is the space of the 
   interpolation control signal.
   This unit generator is 25% faster if <b> is x and <c> is y.
