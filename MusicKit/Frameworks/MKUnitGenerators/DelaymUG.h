	You instantiate a subclass of the form

	<b> = space of input
	<c> = space of delay line

	DelaymUG is useful for flanging, reverberation, plucked string

   that the unused memory in the memory specified in 
   setDelayMemory: is not freed. Resetting the
   length of a running Delay may cause the pointer to go out-of-bounds.
   Therefore, it is prudent to send setPointer: or resetPointer after
   adjustLength:. Also note that when lengthening the delay, you 
   will be bringing in old delayed samples. Therefore, you may
   want to clear the new portion by sending the memory object the
