/* Out2sumUG - from dsp macro /usr/lib/dsp/ugsrc/out2sum.asm (see source for details).

   Out2sum writes its input signal to both channels of the stereo output 
   sample stream of the DSP, adding into that stream. 
   The stream is cleared before each DSP tick (each orchestra program 
   iteration). Out2sum also provides individual scaling on each output channel.
   The method setBearing: allows a convenient way to control the proportion
   of the signal sent to each channel.

   You instantiate a subclass of the form 
   Out2sumUG<a>, where <a> = space of input
