edsnd -- A simple soundfile editor

edsnd is an expansion and revision of Lee Boynton's SoundEditor 
(see /NextDeveloper/Examples).  In changing this program, I tried to add 
features and change the user interface in ways that are more useful 
to the composers here at the Princeton University computer music 
studio.  In particular, this meant expanding the editing capabilities, 
giving more specific timing information about the sounds, among 
other changes.
