      <para>
	Welcome to Spectro V&spectroVer;, a spectrum analysis tool for use in the
	<productname>NeXTStep</productname> environment.  This
	application was originally created by Perry R. Cook (version
	2.497) at the Center for Computer Research in Music and
	Acoustics (<acronym>CCRMA</acronym>), Stanford University.
	Version 3, created by Gary P. Scavone, represents a total
	overhaul of the original application and is compatible with
	Intel based computer systems running the
	<productname>NeXTStep</productname> operating system.  Version
	4 is an update and port to <productname>OpenStep</productname>
	by Stephen Brandon, Leigh Smith and other
	<productname>MusicKit</productname> project developers and is
	therefore operational with Apple's
	<productname>Cocoa</productname> and
	<productname>GnuStep</productname>
	<acronym>API</acronym>s. Direct bugs/suggestions to
        <email>musickit-developer@lists.sourceforge.net</email>.
      </para>

      <para>
	The program performs frequency transforms on sound data and displays
	the resultant spectrum.  This is similar to passing light through a
	prism, which splits it into its component colors.  Because it is
	assumed that not everyone using this application will understand all
	the finer points of spectral analysis, a few helpful hints for the use
	of various features of the program are provided via this help system.
	See "Click for help" or check the Table Of Contents for specific
	topics.

	  in the appropriate sound file window.  However, if a
	  particular sound file window is closed, its associated
	  spectrum window will also be closed.  The sound file window

	<para>
	  The <acronym>RMS</acronym> Error of Peak field provides a relative measure for
	  determining whether the frequency "hump" or lobe being
	  analyzed is representative of a single frequency or biased
	  by other spurious frequencies.  The error is calculated with
	  respect to the main lobe of the window alone.  The given
	  value is mainly of relational significance.  Values less
	  than about 0.1 seem to indicate relative "goodness", but I
	  disclaim any particular accuracy here!  I suggest using a
	  zero-pad factor of at least 4 when using the error feature.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The peak frequency is determined using parabolic interpolation.  This
	  method is not perfect, but the error decreases for an
	  increasing zero-padding factor.  Further, parabolic
	  interpolation is more accurate using windows lower on the
	  pop-up option list (Hanning, Blackman, etc...).
	</para>

	<para>
	  It is suggested that the spectrum view be "zoomed in" when
	  placing the cursor near a frequency peak.  The peak finding
	  method will move along a gradient until a local peak is
	  found.  Thus, it is important to have the cursor located
	  accurately.
