"Reich-o-Matic" synthesizes pseudo-Steve-Reich music in real time using the
Motorola DSP chip and the NeXT MusicKit.  It uses the amazing SlideFlute
physical-model instrument written by Perry Cook (thanks, Perry!).  The
performance model is fairly unintelligent, but occasionally it produces
some snazzy stretches of sound.  I figure this example might also be good for
people wanting to use some of Perry's algorithms; full source is included.

This version doesn't have much in the way of interactive user parameters --
only the "type" of Reich-ness can be selected.  I'm thinking of doing a
version with loads of nifty knobs and sliders to alter the performance
parameters, but that will have to wait for Another Day.

I developed "Reich-o-Matic" on an 040 Cube under OS 2.1, and have tested it
on 040 NeXTStations (Turbo and Otherwise).  I'm not sure how it will work
under 3.0, but you will need the MusicKit if you wish to recompile the
application.

I was pretty amazed at the response I got to my old "Looching" app -- I like
the notion of distributing music over the Net, especially with protocols
like ISDN and ever-increasing bandwidth just around the corner.  Please feel
free to send e-mail with feedback, questions, etc.  Have fun listening!

Just a short addendum to add that Reich-O-Matic has been ported to NS3.2 Intel
so all you Intel only bods can enjoy those flutes as well..."It's Gonna Rain"
