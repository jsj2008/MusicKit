This directory contains the sources files for a Wave Table Editor.
This editor implements a oscillator on the DSP56001 whose wave table can be
mouse-edited. You can therefore actually hear the wave form you are drawing.
Also, a FFT display is included which gives the spectrum corresponding to the
wave table. You can also edit the FFT display, and see and hear the correspon-
ding wave table... Other features are included such as filtering and weigthing.

To compile the application, you need a NeXT machine with a 3.0 system.
Simply type "make" to compile the application.
The application name is "WaveEdit".

Enjoy yourself...
