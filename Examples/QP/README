QuintProcessor examples

The directory contains examples of the use of the Music Kit with the
Ariel QuintProcessor.

To use these examples, you need an Ariel QuintProcessor installed in
slot 2, with an Ariel ProPort attached to the serial port of DSP E.
You should set the ProPort's sampling rate adjustment to 0, "Auto 1".
You must be running release NeXTstep 3.0 and have the slot drivers
correctly installed with the BusProbe application.

At the time of this writing, there are a number of bugs assocated with
the Music Kit's QuintProcessor support.  Please see the MusicKit
release notes for the latest news.

Obviously, since the QuintProcessor works only in the Next Cube, this
code will not work on Intel hardware.
