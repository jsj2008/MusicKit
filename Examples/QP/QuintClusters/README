This example illustrates real-time control of the Ariel QuintProcessor.

To use this program, you need an Ariel QuintProcessor installed in
slot 2, with an Ariel ProPort attached to the serial port of DSP E.
You should set the ProPort's sampling rate adjustment to 0, "Auto 1".
You must be running release NeXTstep 3.0 and have the slot drivers
correctly installed with the BusProbe application.

See the Help menu item for an explanation of the interface.

This example consists of two source files, ExampApp.m, a subclass of 
Application that handles the interface work, and DramEchos.m, a simple
file that sets up and manages a Quint Processor Dynamic RAM echo patch.
