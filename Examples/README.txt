Music Kit Programming Examples

This is the Music Kit programming examples directory.

The Music Kit provides object-oriented access to the music facilities of the NeXT Computer.

The programming examples appear in subdirectories of the current directory.  There are two kinds of programming examples.  Programs with names entirely in lowercase, such as playscorefile, are command-line programs.  Programs with names beginning with an uppercase letter, such as PlayNote, are applications (i.e. graphic-interface programs).

The complete set of programs is listed below.  For further information on a given programming example, see the README file in its directory.

Simple command-line programming examples:

playpart  		Create notes algorithmically and play them 
mixscorefiles    	Mix any number of scorefiles and write the result out
playscorefile   	Read a scorefile into a Score and play it on the DSP
playscorefile2		Read a scorefile and play it on the DSP as it is read
playscorefilemidi	Play scorefile through MIDI out
exampsynthpatch		Demonstrates how to build a SynthPatch and play it.
mixsounds		Soundfile mixer that shows how to make your own 
			Instrument (non-real-time)
process_soundfiles_dsp	Process a sound file through the DSP (non-real-time.)
			Includes SynthPatchs for resonating and enveloping 
			sounds.
QP/playscorefile-qp	Play a scorefile on the Ariel QuintProcessor.

Simple application programming examples:

PlayNote     		Click a button to play and adjust notes on the DSP
PerformerExample  	Adjust algorithmically-generated music playing on DSP
MidiLoop       		Take MIDI input and send it right out MIDI again 
MidiEcho       		Take MIDI in, generate echoes, and send to MIDI output 
MidiRecord     		Read MIDI input into a Score obj, write a scorefile
MidiPlay     		Take MIDI input and play the DSP
SineGen			Interactively adjust the frequency of a sine wave
ResonSound		Real time processing of sound from the DSP serial port.
QP/QuintClusters	Interactive application for the Ariel QuintProcessor.

A large graphic-interface application:

Ensemble		Ensemble combines elements of a sequencer, a voicing
			application and an algorithmic composition 
			application. 

A library of SynthPatches:

libsynthpatches		This is the Music Kit SynthPatch library.
