  Description:
    mixsounds is an example of a MusicKit performance that actually makes
    no sound. Rather, it's "output" is a sound file that is the result of
    a mix of the soundfiles specified in its input scorefile.
    See the README file on this directory for details.

    Since no real-time interaction is involved, and since we want the program
    to run as fast as possible, the MKConductor is set to unclocked mode.
    In unclocked mode the MKConductor's +startPerformance method initiates a
    tight loop that sends MKNotes as fast as possible until all MKNotes have been
    sent, then returns. In this program, each MKNote is actually a
    soundfile mix specification.
